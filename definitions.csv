/m/0mkg,"Accordions ( from 19th-century German Akkordeoncode deu promoted to code de from Akkordcode deu promoted to code de '' musical chord concord of sounds '' ) are a family of box-shaped musical instruments of the bellows-driven free reed aerophone type ( producing sound as air flows past a reed in a frame ) colloquially referred to as a squeezebox A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist The concertina harmoneon and bandoneon are related The harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family but are typically larger than an accordion and sit on a surface or the floor The accordion is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys causing pallets to open which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel called reeds These vibrate to produce sound inside the body Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument 's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block The musician normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand side ( referred to as the manual ) and the accompaniment on bass or pre-set chord buttons on the left-hand side The accordion is widely spread across the world because of the waves of immigration from Europe to the Americas and other regions In some countries ( for example Argentina Brazil Colombia the Dominican Republic Mexico and Panama ) it is used in popular music ( for example chamamé in Argentina gaucho forró and sertanejo in Brazil vallenato in Colombia merengue in the Dominican Republic and norteño in Mexico ) whereas in other regions ( such as Europe North America and other countries in South America ) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music In Europe and North America some popular music acts also make use of the instrument Additionally the accordion is used in cajun zydeco jazz and klezmer music and in both solo and orchestral performances of classical music The piano accordion is the official city instrument of San Francisco California United States Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments The oldest name for this group of instruments is harmonika from the Greek harmonikoscode ell promoted to code el meaning `` harmonic musical '' Today native versions of the name accordion are more common These names refer to the type of accordion patented by Cyrill Demian which concerned `` automatically coupled chords on the bass side '' == History == The accordion 's basic form is believed to have been invented in Berlin in 1822 by Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier.The earliest history of the accordion in Russia is poorly documented Nevertheless according to Russian researchers the earliest known simple accordions were made in Tula Russia by Ivan Sizov and Timofey Vorontsov around 1830 after they received an early accordion from Germany By the late 1840s the instrument was already very widespread together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments"
/m/0k5j,An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines Common examples of aircraft include airplanes helicopters airships ( including blimps ) gliders paramotors and hot air balloons.The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation The science of aviation including designing and building aircraft is called aeronautics Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers Aircraft may be classified by different criteria such as lift type aircraft propulsion usage and others == History == Flying model craft and stories of manned flight go back many centuries however the first manned ascent and safe descent in modern times took place by larger hot-air balloons developed in the 18th century Each of the two World Wars led to great technical advances Consequently the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras Pioneers of flight from the earliest experiments to 1914 First World War 1914 to 1918 Aviation between the World Wars 1918 to 1939 Second World War 1939 to 1945 Postwar era also called the Jet Age 1945 to the present day == Methods of lift == === Lighter than air – aerostats === Aerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water They are characterized by one or more large cells or canopies filled with a relatively low-density gas such as helium hydrogen or hot air which is less dense than the surrounding air When the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces Small hot-air balloons called sky lanterns were first invented in ancient China prior to the 3rd century BC and used primarily in cultural celebrations and were only the second type of aircraft to fly the first being kites which were first invented in ancient China over two thousand years ago ( See Han Dynasty ) A balloon was originally any aerostat while the term airship was used for large powered aircraft designs usually fixed-wing In 1919 Frederick Handley Page was reported as referring to `` ships of the air '' with smaller passenger types as `` Air yachts '' In the 1930s large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as `` ships of the air '' or `` flying-ships '' though none had yet been built The advent of powered balloons called dirigible balloons and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size began to change the way these words were used Huge powered aerostats characterized by a rigid outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags were produced the Zeppelins being the largest and most famous There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships so
/m/046dlr,An alarm clock ( or sometimes just an alarm ) is a clock that is designed to alert an individual or group of individuals at a specified time The primary function of these clocks is to awaken people from their night 's sleep or short naps they are sometimes used for other reminders as well Most use sound some use light or vibration Some have sensors to identify when a person is in a light stage of sleep in order to avoid waking someone who is deeply asleep which causes tiredness even if the person has had adequate sleep To turn off the sound or light a button or handle on the clock is pressed most clocks automatically turn off the alarm if left unattended long enough A classic analog alarm clock has an extra hand or inset dial that is used to specify the time at which the alarm will ring Alarm clocks are also used in mobile phones watches and computers Many alarm clocks have radio receivers that can be set to start playing at specified times and are known as clock radios Some alarm clocks can set multiple alarms A progressive alarm clock can have different alarms for different times ( see next-generation alarms ) and play music of the user 's choice Most modern televisions computers mobile phones and digital watches have alarm functions that turn on or sound alerts at a specific time == Types == === Traditional analogue clocks === Traditional mechanical alarm clocks have one or two bells that ring by means of a mainspring that powers a gear to quickly move a hammer back and forth between the two bells or between the interior sides of a single bell In some models the metal cover at back of the clock itself also functions as the bell In an electronically operated bell-style alarm clock the bell is rung by an electromagnetic circuit and armature to turn the circuit on and off repeatedly === Digital === Digital alarm clocks can make other noises Simple battery-powered alarm clocks make a loud buzzing or beeping sound to wake a sleeper while novelty alarm clocks can speak laugh sing or play sounds from nature == History == The ancient Greek philosopher Plato ( 428–348 BC ) was said to possess a large water clock with an unspecified alarm signal similar to the sound of a water organ he used it at night possibly for signaling the beginning of his lectures at dawn ( Athenaeus 4.174c ) The Hellenistic engineer and inventor Ctesibius ( fl 285–222 BC ) fitted his clepsydras with dial and pointer for indicating the time and added elaborate `` alarm systems which could be made to drop pebbles on a gong or blow trumpets ( by forcing bell-jars down into water and taking the compressed air through a beating reed ) at pre-set times '' ( Vitruv 11.11 ) .The late Roman statesman Cassiodorus ( c. 485–585 ) advocated in his rulebook for monastic life the water clock as a useful alarm for the `` soldiers

I. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle Berry and Colorado City Texas merchants wanted to make their new town site the region 's main trading center On August 30 1887 Berry 's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.The settlement originally was called Oneida it later changed its name to Amarillo which probably derived from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores ( Amarillo is the Spanish word for the color yellow ) Early residents originally pronounced the city 's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation ah-mə-REE-yoh which was later displaced by the current pronunciation On June 19 1888 Henry B.

/m/0c2jj,An axe ( sometimes ax in American English see spelling differences ) is an implement that has been used for millennia to shape split and cut wood to harvest timber as a weapon and as a ceremonial or heraldic symbol The axe has many forms and specialised uses but generally consists of an axe head with a handle or helve Before the modern axe the stone-age hand axe without a handle was used from 1.5 million years BP Hafted axes ( those with a handle ) date only from 6000 BC The earliest examples of handled axes have heads of stone with some form of wooden handle attached ( hafted ) in a method to suit the available materials and use Axes made of copper bronze iron and steel appeared as these technologies developed The axe is an example of a simple machine as it is a type of wedge or dual inclined plane This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade The handle of the axe also acts as a lever allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge—not using the full length of the handle is known as choking the axe For fine chopping using a side axe this sometimes is a positive effect but for felling with a double bitted axe it reduces efficiency Generally cutting axes have a shallow wedge angle whereas splitting axes have a deeper angle Most axes are double bevelled i.e symmetrical about the axis of the blade but some specialist broadaxes have a single bevel blade and usually an offset handle that allows them to be used for finishing work without putting the user 's knuckles at risk of injury Less common today they were once an integral part of a joiner and carpenter 's tool kit not just a tool for use in forestry A tool of similar origin is the billhook Most modern axes have steel heads and wooden handles typically hickory in the US and ash in Europe and Asia although plastic or fibreglass handles are also common Modern axes are specialised by use size and form Hafted axes with short handles designed for use with one hand are often called hand axes but the term hand axe refers to axes without handles as well Hatchets tend to be small hafted axes often with a hammer on the back side ( the poll ) As easy-to-make weapons axes have frequently been used in combat == History == Hand axes of stone and used without handles ( hafts ) were the first axes They had knapped ( chipped ) cutting edges of flint or other stone Early examples of hand axes date back to 1.6 mya in the later Oldowan in Southern Ethiopia around 1.4 mya and in 1.2 mya deposits in Olduvai Gorge Stone axes made with ground cutting edges were first developed sometime in the late Pleistocene in Australia where grind-edge axe fragments from sites in Arnhem Land date back at least

/m/03g8mr,A baseball bat is a smooth wooden or metal club used in the sport of baseball to hit the ball after it is thrown by the pitcher By regulation it may be no more than 2.75 inches ( 7.0 cm ) in diameter at the thickest part and no more than 42 inches ( 1.067 m ) in length Although historically bats approaching 3 pounds ( 1.4 kg ) were swung today bats of 33 ounces ( 0.94 kg ) are common topping out at 34 ounces ( 0.96 kg ) to 36 ounces ( 1.0 kg ) == Terminology == A baseball bat is divided into several regions The `` barrel '' is the thick part of the bat where it is meant to hit the ball The part of the barrel best for hitting the ball according to construction and swinging style is often called the `` sweet spot '' The end of the barrel is called the `` top '' `` end '' or `` cap '' of the bat Opposite the cap the barrel narrows until it meets the `` handle '' which is comparatively thin so that batters can comfortably grip the bat in their hands Sometimes especially on metal bats the handle is wrapped with a rubber or tape `` grip '' Finally below the handle is the `` knob '' of the bat a wider piece that keeps the bat from slipping from a batter 's hands `` Lumber '' is an often-used slang term for a bat especially when wielded by a particularly able batter The `` bat drop '' of a bat is its weight in ounces minus its length in inches For example a 30-ounce 33-inch-long bat has a bat drop of minus 3 ( 30 − 33 = −3 ) Larger bat drops help to increase swing speed smaller drops create more power == History == The bat 's form has become more refined over time In the mid-19th century baseball batters were known to shape or whittle their own bats by hand which resulted in a wide range of shapes sizes and weights For example there were flat bats round bats short bats and fat bats Earlier bats were known to be much heavier and larger than today 's regulated ones During the 19th century many shapes were experimented with as well as handle designs Today bats are much more uniform in design === Innovations === On June 17 1890 Emile Kinst patented the ball-bat or banana bat The bat is shaped with a curve hence the name banana bat The creator of the bat Kinst wrote `` The object of my invention is to provide a ball-bat which shall produce a rotary or spinning motion of the ball in its flight to a higher degree than is possible with any present known form of ball-bat and thus to make it more difficult to catch the ball or if caught to hold it and thus further to modify the conditions of the game '' The mushroom bat made in 1906
/m/03grzl,A baseball glove or mitt is a large glove ( traditionally made of leather today other options do exist ) worn by baseball players of the defending team which assists players in catching and fielding balls hit by a batter or thrown by a teammate By convention the glove is described by the handedness of the intended wearer rather than the hand on which the glove is worn a glove that fits on the left hand—used by a right-handed thrower—is called a right-handed ( RH ) or `` right-hand throw '' ( RHT ) glove Conversely a left-handed glove ( LH or LHT ) is worn on the right hand allowing the player to throw the ball with the left hand == History == Early baseball was a game played without gloves During the slow transition to gloves a player who continued to play without one was called a barehanded catcher this did not refer to the position of catcher but rather to the practice of catching with bare hands The earliest glove was not webbed and not particularly well suited for catching but was used more to swat a ball to the ground so that it could be picked up One of the first players believed to use a baseball glove was Doug Allison a catcher for the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1870 due to an injured left hand The first confirmed glove use was by Charlie Waitt a St. Louis outfielder and first baseman who in 1875 donned a pair of flesh-colored gloves Glove use slowly caught on as more and more players began using different forms of gloves Many early baseball gloves were simple leather gloves with the fingertips cut off supposedly to allow for the same control of a bare hand but with extra padding First baseman Albert Spalding originally skeptical of glove use influenced more infielders to begin using gloves Spalding later founded the sporting goods company Spalding which still manufactures baseball gloves along with other sports equipment By the mid-1890s it was normal for players to wear gloves in the field In 1920 Bill Doak a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals suggested that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb in order to create a pocket This design soon became the standard for baseball gloves Doak patented his design and sold it to Rawlings His design became the precursor to modern gloves and enabled Rawlings to become the preferred glove of professional players.For many years it was customary for fielders to leave their gloves on the field when their team went in to bat This practice was prohibited by the major leagues in 1954.Baseball gloves have grown progressively larger since their inception While catching in baseball had always been two-handed eventually gloves grew to a size that made it easier to catch the ball in the webbing of the glove and use the off-hand to keep it from falling out A glove is typically worn on the non-dominant hand leaving the dominant hand for throwing the ball for example a right-handed

/m/03dnzn,A bathtub also known simply as a bath or tub is a container for holding water in which a person or animal may bathe Most modern bathtubs are made of thermoformed acrylic porcelain-enameled steel or cast iron or fiberglass-reinforced polyester A bathtub is usually placed in a bathroom either as a stand-alone fixture or in conjunction with a shower Modern bathtubs have overflow and waste drains and may have taps mounted on them They are usually built-in but may be free-standing or sometimes sunken Until acrylic thermoforming technology permitted other shapes virtually all bathtubs used to be roughly rectangular Bathtubs are commonly white in color although many other colors can be found Two main styles are common Western style bathtubs in which the bather lies down These baths are typically shallow and long Eastern style bathtubs in which the bather sits up These are known as furo in Japan and are typically short and deep == History of bathtubs and bathing == Documented early plumbing systems for bathing go back as far as around 3300 BC with the discovery of copper water pipes beneath a palace in ancient Europe Evidence of the earliest surviving personal sized bath tub was found on the Isle of Crete where a 1.5-metre ( 5 ft ) long pedestal tub was found built from hardened pottery.The clawfoot tub which reached the apex of its popularity in the late 19th century had its origins in the mid 18th century when the ball and claw design originated in the Netherlands possibly artistically inspired by the Chinese motif of a dragon holding a precious stone The design spread to England where it found much popularity among the aristocracy just as bathing was becoming increasingly fashionable Early bathtubs in England tended to be made of cast iron or even tin and copper with a face of paint applied that tended to peel with time The Scottish-born inventor David Buick invented a process for bonding porcelain enamel to cast iron in the 1880s while working for the Alexander Manufacturing Company in Detroit The company as well as others including Kohler Company and J. L. Mott Iron Works began successfully marketing porcelain enameled cast-iron bathtubs a process that remains broadly the same to this day Far from the ornate feet and luxury most associated with clawfoot tubs an early Kohler example was advertised as a `` horse trough/hog scalder when furnished with four legs will serve as a bathtub '' The item 's use as a hog scalder was considered a more important marketing point than its ability to function as a bathtub In the latter half of the 20th century the once popular clawfoot tub morphed into a built-in tub with a small apron front This enclosed style afforded easier maintenance and with the emergence of colored sanitary ware more design options for the homeowner The Crane Company introduced colored bathroom fixtures to the United States market in 1928 and slowly this influx of design options and easier cleaning and care led to the near demise of clawfoot-style tubs In the 1960s
/m/0d20w4,The beak bill or rostrum is an external anatomical structure found mostly in birds but also in turtles non-avian dinosaurs and a few mammals A beak is used for eating preening manipulating objects killing prey fighting probing for food courtship and feeding young The terms beak and rostrum are also used to refer to a similar mouth part in some ornithischians pterosaurs cetaceans dicynodonts anuran tadpoles monotremes ( i.e echidnas and platypuses which have a beak-like structure ) sirens pufferfish billfishes and cephalopods Although beaks vary significantly in size shape color and texture they share a similar underlying structure Two bony projections – the upper and lower mandibles – are covered with a thin keratinized layer of epidermis known as the rhamphotheca In most species two holes called nares lead to the respiratory system == Etymology == Although the word `` beak '' was in the past generally restricted to the sharpened bills of birds of prey in modern ornithology the terms beak and bill are generally considered to be synonymous The word which dates from the 13th century comes from the Middle English bec which itself comes from the Latin beccus == Anatomy == Although beaks vary significantly in size and shape from species to species their underlying structures have a similar pattern All beaks are composed of two jaws generally known as the upper mandible ( or maxilla ) and lower mandible ( or mandible ) ( p147 ) The upper and in some cases the lower mandibles are strengthened internally by a complex three-dimensional network of bony spicules ( or trabeculae ) seated in soft connective tissue and surrounded by the hard outer layers of the beak ( p149 ) The avian jaw apparatus is made up of two units one four-bar linkage mechanism and one five-bar linkage mechanism === Mandibles === The upper mandible is supported by a three-pronged bone called the intermaxillary The upper prong of this bone is embedded into the forehead while the two lower prongs attach to the sides of the skull At the base of the upper mandible a thin sheet of nasal bones is attached to the skull at the nasofrontal hinge which gives mobility to the upper mandible allowing it to move upwards and downwards The base of the upper mandible or the roof when seen from the mouth is the palate the structure of which differs greatly in the ratites Here the vomer is large and connects with premaxillae and maxillopalatine bones in a condition termed as a `` paleognathous palate '' All other extant birds have a narrow forked vomer that does not connect with other bones and is then termed as neognathous The shape of these bones varies across the bird families.The lower mandible is supported by a bone known as the inferior maxillary bone—a compound bone composed of two distinct ossified pieces These ossified plates ( or rami ) which can be U-shaped or V-shaped ( p147 ) join distally ( the exact location of the joint depends on the species ) but are separated proximally attaching

/m/020jm,"Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera ( ) in the superorder Endopterygota Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases elytra distinguishing them from most other insects The Coleoptera with about 400,000 described species is the largest of all orders constituting almost 40 % of described insects and 25 % of all known animal life-forms new species are discovered frequently with estimates suggesting that there are between 0.9 and 2.1 million total species Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions they interact with their ecosystems in several ways beetles often feed on plants and fungi break down animal and plant debris and eat other invertebrates Some species are serious agricultural pests such as the Colorado potato beetle while others such as Coccinellidae ( ladybirds or ladybugs ) eat aphids scale insects thrips and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects although there are several examples of novelty such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving Beetles are endopterygotes which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage Some such as stag beetles have a marked sexual dimorphism the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males Many beetles are aposematic with bright colors and patterns warning of their toxicity while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects Many beetles including those that live in sandy places have effective camouflage Beetles are prominent in human culture from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively colored making them objects of collection and decorative displays Over 300 species are used as food mostly as larvae species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae However the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural forestry and horticultural pests Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton the Colorado potato beetle the coconut hispine beetle and the mountain pine beetle Most beetles however do not cause economic damage and many such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests == Etymology == The name of the taxonomic order Coleoptera comes from the Greek koleopteros ( κολεόπτερος ) given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra hardened shield-like forewings from koleos sheath and pteron wing The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela little biter related to bītan ( to bite ) leading to Middle English betylle Another Old English name for beetle is ċeafor chafer used in names such as cockchafer from the Proto-Germanic * kebrô ( `` beetle '' compare"
/m/0cvnqh,A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock such as sand gravel shingle pebbles etc. or biological sources such as mollusc shells or coralline algae Sediments settle in different densities and structures depending on the local wave action and weather creating different textures colors and gradients or layers of material Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes like wave action and extreme weather events Where wind conditions are correct beaches can be backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach However these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth 's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise.Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines These beaches are popular for recreation playing important economic and cultural roles—often driving local tourism industries To support these uses some beaches have man-made infrastructure such as lifeguard posts changing rooms showers shacks and bars They may also have hospitality venues ( such as resorts camps hotels and restaurants ) nearby or housing both for permanent and seasonal residents Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines while indirect human impacts include water pollution plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment Wild beaches also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches are not developed for tourism or recreation Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins Preserved beaches and their associated dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland ecosystems and human infrastructure == Location and profile == Although the seashore is most commonly associated with the word beach beaches are also found by lakes and alongside large rivers Beach may refer to small systems where rock material moves onshore offshore or alongshore by the forces of waves and currents or geological units of considerable size.The former are described in detail below the larger geological units are discussed elsewhere under bars There are several conspicuous parts to a beach that relate to the processes that form and shape it The part mostly above water ( depending upon tide ) and more or less actively influenced by the waves at some point in the tide is termed the beach berm The berm is the deposit of material comprising the active shoreline The berm has a crest ( top ) and a face—the latter being the slope leading down towards the water
/m/03p3bw,A bicycle helmet is a type of helmet designed to attenuate impacts to the head of a cyclist in falls while minimizing side effects such as interference with peripheral vision There is ongoing scientific research into the degree of protection offered by bicycle helmets in the event of an accident and the effects of helmet wearing on cyclist and motor vehicle driver behaviour There is active debate over what can be concluded from available studies and on whether the use of helmets by cyclists should be promoted or mandated either just for children or for cyclists of all ages In particular the debate over bicycle helmet laws has been intense and occasionally bitter often based not only on differing interpretations of the scientific and other academic literature but also on differing assumptions and interests of various parties == History == === History of designs === A cycle helmet should generally be light in weight and provide ample ventilation because cycling can be an intense aerobic activity which significantly raises body temperature and the head in particular needs to be able to regulate its temperature The dominant form of the helmet up to the 1970s was the leather `` hairnet '' style This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts but only minimal impact protection and was mainly used by racing cyclists More widespread use of helmets began in the US in the 1970s After many decades when bicycles were regarded largely as children 's toys many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s Two of the first modern bicycle helmets were made by MSR a manufacturer of mountaineering equipment and Bell Sports a manufacturer of helmets for auto racing and motorcycles These helmets were a spin-off from the development of expanded polystyrene foam liners for motorcycling and motorsport helmets and had hard polycarbonate plastic shells The bicycle helmet arm of Bell was split off in 1991 as Bell Sports Inc. having completely overtaken the motorcycle and motorsports helmet business The first commercially successful purpose-designed bicycle helmet was the Bell Biker a polystyrene-lined hard shell released in 1975 At the time there was no appropriate standard the only applicable one from Snell would be passed only by a light open-face motorcycle helmet Over time the design was refined and by 1983 Bell were making the V1-Pro the first polystyrene helmet intended for racing use In 1984 Bell produced the Lil Bell Shell a no-shell children 's helmet These early helmets had little ventilation In 1985 Snell B85 was introduced the first widely adopted standard for bicycle helmets this has subsequently been refined into B90 and B95 ( see Standards below ) At this time helmets were almost all either hard-shell or no-shell ( perhaps with a vacuum-formed plastic cover ) Ventilation was still minimal due mainly to technical limitations of the foams and shells in use Around 1990 a new construction technique was invented in-mould micro shell A very thin shell was incorporated during the moulding process This rapidly became the dominant technology allowing for larger
/m/01bqk0,A bicycle wheel is a wheel most commonly a wire wheel designed for a bicycle A pair is often called a wheelset especially in the context of ready built `` off the shelf '' performance-oriented wheels Bicycle wheels are typically designed to fit into the frame and fork via dropouts and hold bicycle tires == Invention == The first wheel to use the tension in metal spokes was invented by Sir George Cayley to achieve lightness in his 1853 glider == Construction == The first bicycle wheels followed the traditions of carriage building a wooden hub a fixed steel axle ( the bearings were located in the fork ends ) wooden spokes and a shrink fitted iron tire A typical modern wheel has a metal hub wire tension spokes and a metal or carbon fiber rim which holds a pneumatic rubber tire === Hub === A hub is the center part of a bicycle wheel It consists of an axle bearings and a hub shell The hub shell typically has two machined metal flanges to which spokes can be attached Hub shells can be one-piece with press-in cartridge or free bearings or in the case of older designs the flanges may be affixed to a separate hub shell ==== Axle ==== The axle is attached to dropouts on the fork or the frame The axle can attach using a Quick release a lever and skewer that pass through a hollow axle designed to allow for installation and removal of the wheel without any tools ( found on most modern road bikes and some mountain bikes ) Nut the axle is threaded and protrudes past the sides of the fork/frame ( often found on track fixed gear single speed BMX and inexpensive bikes ) Bolt the axle has a hole with threads cut into it and a bolt can be screwed into those threads ( found on some single speed hubs Cannondale Lefty hubs ) Thru axle a removable axle with a threaded end that is inserted through a hole in one fork leg through the hub and then screwed into the other fork leg Some axles have integrated cam levers that compress axle elements against the fork leg to lock it in place while others rely on pinch bolts on the fork leg to secure it Diameters for front thru axles include 20 mm 15 mm 12 mm and 9 mm Rear axles typically have diameters of 10 or 12 mm Most thru axles are found on mountain bikes although increasingly disc-braked cyclocross and road bikes are using them Thru axles repeatably locate the wheel in the fork or frame which is important to prevent misalignment of brake rotors when using disc brakes Unlike other axle systems ( except Lefty ) the thru axle is specific to the fork or frame not the hub Hubs/wheels do not include axles and the axle is generally supplied with the fork or frame Adapters are usually available to convert wheels suitable for a larger thru axle to a smaller diameter and to standard 9mm quick

/m/01knjb,A billboard ( also called a hoarding in the UK and many other parts of the world ) is a large outdoor advertising structure ( a billing board ) typically found in high-traffic areas such as alongside busy roads Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers Typically brands use billboards to build their brands or to push for their new products The largest ordinary-sized billboards are located primarily on major highways expressways or principal arterials and command high-density consumer exposure ( mostly to vehicular traffic ) These afford greatest visibility due not only to their size but because they allow creative `` customizing '' through extensions and embellishments Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads Posters are a smaller format and are viewed principally by residents and commuter traffic with some pedestrian exposure == Advertising style == Billboard advertisements are designed to catch a person 's attention and create a memorable impression very quickly leaving the reader thinking about the advertisement after they have driven past it They have to be readable in a very short time because they are usually read while being passed at high speeds Thus there are usually only a few words in large print and a humorous or arresting image in brilliant color Some billboard designs spill outside the actual space given to them by the billboard with parts of figures hanging off the billboard edges or jutting out of the billboard in three dimensions An example in the United States around the turn of the 21st century was the Chick-fil-A billboards ( a chicken sandwich fast food chain ) which had three-dimensional cow figures in the act of painting the billboards with misspelled anti-beef slogans such as `` frendz do n't let frendz eat beef '' The first `` scented billboard '' an outdoor sign emitting the odors of black pepper and charcoal to suggest a grilled steak was erected on NC 150 near Mooresville North Carolina by the Bloom grocery chain The sign depicted a giant cube of beef being pierced by a large fork that extended to the ground The scents were emitted between 7–10 am and 4–7 pm from 28 May 2010 through 18 June 2010 == Painted billboards == Almost all these billboards were painted in large studios The image was projected on the series of paper panels that made up the billboard Line drawings were done then traced with a pounce wheel that created perforated lines The patterns were then `` pounced '' onto the board with a chalk filled pounce bag marking the outlines of the figures or objects Using oil paints artists would use large brushes to paint the image Once the panels were installed using hydraulic cranes artists would go up on the installed billboard and touch up the edges between panels These large painted billboards were especially popular in Los Angeles where historic firms such as Foster & Kleiser and Pacific Outdoor Advertising dominated the industry Eventually these painted billboards gave way to graphic reproduction
/m/04p0qw,A billiard table or billiards table is a bounded table on which cue sports are played In the modern era all billiards tables ( whether for carom billiards pool pyramid or snooker ) provide a flat surface usually made of quarried slate that is covered with cloth ( usually of a tightly woven worsted wool called baize ) and surrounded by vulcanized rubber cushions with the whole thing elevated above the floor 115 238 More specific terms are used for specific sports such as snooker table and pool table and different-sized billiard balls are used on these table types An obsolete term is billiard board used in the 16th and 17th centuries 27 == Parts and equipment == === Cushions === Cushions ( also sometimes called `` rail cushions '' `` cushion rubber '' or rarely `` bumpers '' ) are located on the inner sides of a table 's wooden rails There are several different materials and design philosophies associated with cushion rubber These cushions are made from an elastic material such as vulcanized rubber ( gum or synthetic ) The purpose of the cushion rubber is to cause the billiard balls to rebound off the rubber while minimizing the loss of kinetic energy.The profile of the rail cushion which is the cushion 's angle in relation to the bed of the table varies between table types The standard on American pool tables is the K-66 profile which as defined by the Billiard Congress of America ( BCA ) has a base of 1+3⁄16 inches ( 30 mm ) and a nose height of 1 inch ( 25 mm ) When installed properly the distance from the nose of the cushion to the covered slate surface is 1+7⁄16 inches ( 37 mm ) while using a regulation 2+1⁄4-inch ( 57 mm ) ball set.On a carom table the K-55 profile is used ( with a somewhat sharper angle than pool cushions ) K-55 cushions have cloth usually canvas vulcanized into the top of the rubber to adjust rebound accuracy and speed.Snooker tables use an L-shaped profile such as the L77 profile === Bed === The bed table – the cloth-covered horizontal playing surface – is on high-quality equipment made of solid smooth slabs of slate most often from Italy Brazil or China Small pool tables may use only one or two pieces of slate while carom English billiards and tournament-size pool tables use three Full-size snooker tables require five The gap between slates is filled with a hard-drying putty epoxy or resin then sanded to produce a seamless surface before being covered with the cloth When several pieces of slate are joined poorly it is possible for the resin to deform and cause an uneven playing surface it can also be difficult to move once joined.Tables for the home market usually use slate beds as well but the slate is often thinner down to about +1⁄2 inch ( 13 mm ) The early table beds were made of cloth-covered wooden boards Today inexpensive but not very rigid or durable materials used
/m/0lt4_,Binoculars or field glasses are two refracting telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point in the same direction allowing the viewer to use both eyes ( binocular vision ) when viewing distant objects Most binoculars are sized to be held using both hands although sizes vary widely from opera glasses to large pedestal-mounted military models Unlike a ( monocular ) telescope binoculars give users a three-dimensional image each eyepiece presents a slightly different image to each of the viewer 's eyes and the parallax allows the visual cortex to generate an impression of depth == Optical designs == === Galilean === Almost from the invention of the telescope in the 17th century the advantages of mounting two of them side by side for binocular vision seems to have been explored Most early binoculars used Galilean optics that is they used a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens The Galilean design has the advantage of presenting an erect image but has a narrow field of view and is not capable of very high magnification This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses or theater glasses The Galilean design is also used in low magnification binocular surgical and jewelers loupes because they can be very short and produce an upright image without extra or unusual erecting optics reducing expense and overall weight They also have large exit pupils making centering less critical and the narrow field of view works well in those applications These are typically mounted on an eyeglass frame or custom-fit onto eyeglasses === Keplerian === An improved image and higher magnification are achieved in binoculars employing Keplerian optics where the image formed by the objective lens is viewed through a positive eyepiece lens ( ocular ) Since the Keplerian configuration produces an inverted image different methods are used to turn the image the right way up ==== Erecting lenses ==== In aprismatic binoculars with Keplerian optics ( which were sometimes called `` twin telescopes '' ) each tube has one or two additional lenses ( relay lens ) between the objective and the eyepiece These lenses are used to erect the image The binoculars with erecting lenses had a serious disadvantage they are too long Such binoculars were popular in the 1800s ( for example G. & S.

/m/01j3zr,A burrito ( English Spanish [ buˈrito ] ( listen ) ) is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in Ciudad Juárez consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it make it more pliable and allow it to adhere to itself Burritos are often eaten by hand as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together Burritos can also be served `` wet '' i.e. covered in a savory and spicy sauce when they would be eaten with a fork and knife Burritos are filled with savory ingredients most often a meat such as beef chicken or pork and often include other ingredients such as rice cooked beans ( either whole or refried ) vegetables such as lettuce and tomatoes cheese and condiments such as salsa pico de gallo guacamole or crema Burritos are often contrasted with similar dishes such as tacos in which a small hand-sized tortilla is folded in half around the ingredients rather than wrapped and sealed or with enchiladas which use corn masa tortillas and are covered in a savory sauce to be eaten with a fork and knife == Etymology == The word burrito means `` little donkey '' in Spanish the diminutive form of burro or `` donkey '' The name burrito as applied to the dish possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a large burden == History == Before the development of the modern burrito the Maya civilization of Mexico used corn tortillas as early as 1500 B.C to wrap foods with fillings of chili peppers tomatoes mushrooms squash and avocados Historically the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco rather than the modern burrito The precise origin of the modern burrito is not known In the 1895 Diccionario de Mejicanismos by Feliz Ramos i Duarte the burrito or taco was identified as a regional item from the Mexican state of Guanajuato and defined as `` Tortilla arrollada con carne u otra cosa dentro que en Yucatán llaman coçito y en Cuernavaca y en Mexico taco '' ( A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside called 'coçito in Yucatán and 'taco in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City ) Some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros the cowboys of northern Mexico in the 19th century.An often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan Méndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez during the Mexican Revolution period ( 1910–1921 ) while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food To keep the food warm Méndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a
/m/01bjv,A bus ( contracted from omnibus with variants multibus motorbus autobus etc ) is a road vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or van It is most commonly used in public transport but is also in use for charter purposes or through private ownership Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads Coaches are used for longer-distance services Many types of buses such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches charge a fare Other types such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus are free In many jurisdictions bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport scheduled coach transport school transport private hire or tourism promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes including rock and pop band tour vehicles Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s followed by steam buses in the 1830s and electric trolleybuses in 1882 The first internal combustion engine buses or motor buses were used in 1895 Recently interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses fuel cell buses and electric buses as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel As of the 2010s bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised with the same designs appearing around the world == Name == The name 'Bus is a shortened form of the Latin adjectival form omnibus ( `` for all '' ) the dative plural of omnis/omne ( `` all '' ) The theoretical full name is in French voiture omnibus ( `` vehicle for all '' ) The name originates from a mass-transport service started in 1823 by a French corn-mill owner named Stanislas Baudry in Richebourg a suburb of Nantes A by-product of his mill was hot water and thus next to it he established a spa business In order to encourage customers he started a horse-drawn transport service from the city centre of Nantes to his establishment The first vehicles stopped in front of the shop of a hatter named Omnés which displayed a large sign inscribed `` Omnes Omnibus '' a pun on his Latin-sounding surname omnes being the male and female nominative vocative and accusative form of the Latin adjective omnis/-e ( `` all '' ) combined with omnibus the dative plural form meaning `` for all '' thus giving his shop the name `` Omnés for all '' or `` everything for everyone '' His transport scheme was a huge success although not as he had intended as most of his passengers did not visit his spa He turned the transport service into his principal lucrative business venture and closed the mill and spa Nantes citizens soon gave the nickname `` omnibus '' to the vehicle Having invented
/m/0cyf8,Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera which also includes moths Adult butterflies have large often brightly coloured wings and conspicuous fluttering flight The group comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea which contains at least one former group the skippers ( formerly the superfamily `` Hesperioidea '' ) and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies ( formerly the superfamily `` Hedyloidea '' ) Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene about 56 million years ago Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle as like most insects they undergo complete metamorphosis Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae known as caterpillars will feed The caterpillars grow sometimes very rapidly and when fully developed pupate in a chrysalis When metamorphosis is complete the pupal skin splits the adult insect climbs out and after its wings have expanded and dried it flies off Some butterflies especially in the tropics have several generations in a year while others have a single generation and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle Butterflies are often polymorphic and many species make use of camouflage mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators Some like the monarch and the painted lady migrate over long distances Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids including wasps protozoans flies and other invertebrates or are preyed upon by other organisms Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees other species are agents of pollination of some plants Larvae of a few butterflies ( e.g. harvesters ) eat harmful insects and a few are predators of ants while others live as mutualists in association with ants Culturally butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts The Smithsonian Institution says `` butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature '' == Etymology == The Oxford English Dictionary derives the word straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge butter-fly similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German show that the name is ancient but modern Dutch and German use different words ( vlinder and Schmetterling ) and the common name often varies substantially between otherwise closely-related languages A possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone ( Gonepteryx rhamni ) another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during the spring and summer butter season while the grass was growing == Paleontology == The earliest Lepidoptera fossils date to the Triassic-Jurassic boundary around 200 million years ago Butterflies evolved from moths so while the butterflies are monophyletic ( forming a single clade ) the moths are not The oldest known butterfly is Protocoeliades kristenseni from the Palaeocene aged Fur Formation of Denmark approximately 55 million years old which belongs to the family Hesperiidae ( skippers ) Molecular clock estimates suggest that butterflies originated sometime in the mid-Cretaceous but only significantly diversified during the Cenozoic The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant

/m/02mqfb,A can opener ( in North American English and Australian English ) or tin opener ( used in British English ) is a mechanical device used to open tin cans ( metal cans ) Although preservation of food using tin cans had been practiced since at least 1772 in the Netherlands the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States These early openers were basically variations of a knife though the 1855 design continues to be produced The first can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating cutting wheel that runs round the can 's rim to cut open the lid was invented in 1870 but was considered very difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer A successful design came out in 1925 when a second serrated wheel was added to hold the cutting wheel on the rim of the can This easy-to-use design has become one of the most popular can opener models Around the time of World War II several can openers were developed for military use such as the American P-38 and P-51 These featured a robust and compact design with a pull cutting blade hinged to a corrugated handle with a pivot Electric can openers were introduced in the late 1950s and met with success The development of new can opener types continues with a recent redesign of a side-cutting model == Invention of cans == Food preserved in tin cans was in use by the Dutch Navy from at least 1772 Before 1800 there was already a small industry of canned salmon in the Netherlands Freshly caught salmon were cleaned boiled in brine smoked and placed in tin-plated iron boxes This canned salmon was known outside the Netherlands and in 1797 a British company supplied one of their clients with 13 cans Preservation of food in tin cans was patented by Peter Durand in 1810 The patent was acquired in 1812 by Bryan Donkin who soon set up the world 's first canning factory in London in 1813 By 1820 canned food was a recognised article in Britain and France and by 1822 in the United States The first cans were robust containers which weighed more than the food they contained and required ingenuity to open using whatever tools available The instruction on those cans read `` Cut round the top near the outer edge with a chisel and hammer '' The gap of decades between the invention of the can and can opener may be attributed to the functionality of existing tools versus the cost and effort of a new tool == Twist-key can-opener == Also called Tin can key can-opener During the 1800s the canning process was mechanised and refined with can walls becoming thinner The twist-key can-opener was patented by J. Osterhoudt in 1866 There still was no general-purpose can-opener thus each can came with a spot-welded or soldered-on twist-key can-opener which snapped off after fatiguing the metal by bending at a thin region Each food-type had its own can-type and came with its own

/m/020kz,The English modal verbs are a subset of the English auxiliary verbs used mostly to express modality ( properties such as possibility obligation etc. ) They can be distinguished from other verbs by their defectiveness ( they do not have participle or infinitive forms ) and by their neutralization ( that they do not take the ending ( e ) s in the third-person singular ) The principal English modal verbs are can could may might shall should will would and must Certain other verbs are sometimes classed as modals these include ought had better and ( in certain uses ) dare and need Verbs which share only some of the characteristics of the principal modals are sometimes called `` quasi-modals '' `` semi-modals '' or `` pseudo-modals '' == Modal verbs and their features == The verbs customarily classed as modals in English have the following properties They do not inflect ( in the modern language ) except insofar as some of them come in present–past ( present–preterite ) pairs They do not add the ending ( e ) s in the third-person singular ( the present-tense modals therefore follow the preterite-present paradigm ) They are defective they are not used as infinitives or participles ( except occasionally in non-standard English see § Double modals below ) nor as imperatives nor ( in the standard way ) as subjunctives They function as auxiliary verbs they modify the modality of another verb which they govern This verb generally appears as a bare infinitive although in some definitions a modal verb can also govern the to-infinitive ( as in the case of ought ) They have the syntactic properties associated with auxiliary verbs in English principally that they can undergo subject–auxiliary inversion ( in questions for example ) and can be negated by the appending of not after the verb The following verbs have all of the above properties and can be classed as the principal modal verbs of English They are listed here in present–preterite pairs where applicable can and could may and might shall and should will and would must ( no preterite see etymology below ) Note that the preterite forms are not necessarily used to refer to past time and in some cases they are near-synonyms to the present forms Note that most of these so-called preterite forms are most often used in the subjunctive mood in the present tense The auxiliary verbs may and let are also used often in the subjunctive mood Famous examples of these are `` May The Force be with you '' and `` Let God bless you with good '' These are both sentences that express some uncertainty hence they are subjunctive sentences The verbs listed below mostly share the above features but with certain differences They are sometimes but not always categorized as modal verbs They may also be called `` semi-modals '' The verb ought differs from the principal modals only in that it governs a to-infinitive rather than a bare infinitive ( compare he should go with he ought to
/m/0kpt_,The cantaloupe rockmelon ( Australia and New Zealand although cantaloupe is used in some states of Australia ) sweet melon or spanspek ( Southern Africa ) is a melon that is a variety of the muskmelon species ( Cucumis melo ) from the family Cucurbitaceae Cantaloupes range in mass from 0.5 to 5 kilograms ( 1 to 11 lb ) Originally cantaloupe referred only to the non-netted orange-fleshed melons of Europe but today may refer to any orange-fleshed melon of the C. melo species == Etymology and origin == The name cantaloupe was derived in the 18th century via French cantaloup from The Cantus Region of Italian Cantalupo which was formerly a papal county seat near Rome after the fruit was introduced there from Armenia It was first mentioned in English literature in 1739 The cantaloupe most likely originated in a region from South Asia to Africa It was later introduced to Europe and around 1890 became a commercial crop in the United States.Melon derived from use in Old French as meloun during the 13th century and from Medieval Latin melonem a kind of pumpkin It was among the first plants to be domesticated and cultivated.The South African English name spanspek is said to be derived from Afrikaans Spaanse spek ( 'Spanish bacon ) supposedly Sir Harry Smith a 19th-century governor of Cape Colony ate bacon and eggs for breakfast while his Spanish-born wife Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith preferred cantaloupe so South Africans nicknamed the eponymous fruit Spanish bacon However the name appears to predate the Smiths and date to 18th-century Dutch Suriname J. van Donselaar wrote in 1770 `` Spaansch-spek is the name for the form that grows in Suriname which because of its thick skin and little flesh is less consumed '' == Types == The European cantaloupe C. melo var cantalupensis is lightly ribbed with a sweet and flavorful flesh and a gray-green skin that looks quite different from that of the North American cantaloupe.The North American cantaloupe C. melo var reticulatus common in the United States Mexico and some parts of Canada is a different variety of C. melo a muskmelon with a reticulated ( `` net-like '' ) peel It is a round melon with firm orange moderately sweet flesh == Production == In 2016 global production of melons including cantaloupes totaled 31.2 million tons with China accounting for 51 % of the world total ( 15.9 million tons ) Other significant countries growing cantaloupe were Turkey Iran Egypt and India producing 1 to 1.9 million tons respectively.California grows 75 % of the cantaloupes in the US == Consumption == Cantaloupe is normally eaten as a fresh fruit as a salad or as a dessert with ice cream or custard Melon pieces wrapped in prosciutto are a familiar antipasto The seeds are edible and may be dried for use as a snack Because the surface of a cantaloupe can contain harmful bacteria—in particular Salmonella—it is recommended that a melon be washed and scrubbed thoroughly before cutting and consumption The fruit should be refrigerated
/m/0k4j,The cat ( Felis catus ) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species it has a strong flexible body quick reflexes sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing purring trilling hissing growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language Although the cat is a social species it is a solitary hunter As a predator it is crepuscular i.e most active at dawn and dusk It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears such as those made by mice and other small mammals It also secretes and perceives pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats a hobby known as cat fancy Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide contributing to the extinction of entire bird mammal and reptile species.It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.As of 2021 there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world As of 2017 the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat In the United Kingdom 26 % of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020 == Etymology and naming == The origin of the English word cat Old English catt is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century It was suggested that cattus is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau 'tomcat or its feminine form suffixed with -t. The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or Nilo-Saharan language The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ However it is `` equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word imported into Latin and thence to Greek
/m/01lrl,A carnivore or meat-eater ( Latin caro genitive carnis meaning meat or `` flesh '' and vorare meaning `` to devour '' ) is an animal or plant whose food and energy requirements derive from animal tissues ( mainly muscle fat and other soft tissues ) whether through hunting or scavenging == Nomenclature == === Mammal order === The technical term for mammals in the order Carnivora is carnivoran and they are so-named because most member species in the group have a carnivorous diet but the similarity of the name of the order and the name of the diet causes confusion Many but not all carnivorans are meat eaters a few such as the large and small cats ( felidae ) are obligate carnivores ( see below ) Other classes of carnivore are highly variable The Ursids for example While the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively ( more than 90 % of its diet is meat ) almost all other bear species are omnivorous and one species the giant panda is nearly exclusively herbivorous.Dietary carnivory is not a distinguishing trait of the order Many mammals with highly carnivorous diets are not members of the order Carnivora Cetaceans for example all eat other animals but are paradoxically members of the almost exclusively plant-eating hooved mammals === Carnivorous diet === Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called hypercarnivores or obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called mesocarnivores or facultative carnivores or omnivores ( there are no clear distinctions ) A carnivore at the top of the food chain ( adults not preyed upon by other animals ) is termed an apex predator regardless of whether it is an obligate or facultative carnivore Outside the animal kingdom there are several genera containing carnivorous plants ( predominantly insectivores ) and several phyla containing carnivorous fungi ( preying mostly on microscopic invertebrates such as nematodes amoebae and springtails ) === Subcategories of carnivory === Carnivores are sometimes characterized by their type of prey For example animals that eat mainly insects and similar invertebrates are called insectivores while those that eat mainly fish are called piscivores Carnivores may alternatively be classified according to the percentage of meat in their diet The diet of a hypercarnivore consists of more than 70 % meat that of a mesocarnivore 30–70 % and that of a hypocarnivore less than 30 % with the balance consisting of non-animal foods such as fruits other plant material or fungi Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food and apart from their more general definition there is no clearly defined ratio of plant vs. animal material that distinguishes a facultative carnivore from an omnivore == Obligate carnivores == Obligate or `` true '' carnivores are those whose diet requires nutrients found only in animal flesh While obligate carnivores might be able to ingest small amounts of plant matter they lack the necessary physiology required to fully digest it Some obligate carnivorous mammals will ingest vegetation as an emetic to self-induce vomiting the food that
/m/0fj52s,Parrots also known as psittacines ( ) are birds of the roughly 398 species in 92 genera comprising the order Psittaciformes ( ) found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions The order is subdivided into three superfamilies the Psittacoidea ( `` true '' parrots ) the Cacatuoidea ( cockatoos ) and the Strigopoidea ( New Zealand parrots ) One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction with higher aggregate extinction risk ( IUCN Red List Index ) than any other comparable bird group Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere as well The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.Characteristic features of parrots include a strong curved bill an upright stance strong legs and clawed zygodactyl feet Many parrots are vividly coloured and some are multi-coloured Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of length The most important components of most parrots diets are seeds nuts fruit buds and other plant material A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows ( or nest boxes in captivity ) and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial ( helpless ) young Parrots along with ravens crows jays and magpies are among the most intelligent birds and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade as well as hunting habitat loss and competition from invasive species has diminished wild populations with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds As of 2021 about 50 million parrots ( half of all parrots ) live in captivity with the vast majority of these living as pets in people 's homes Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems Parrots are the only creatures that display true tripedalism using their necks and beaks as limbs with propulsive forces equal to or greater than those forces generated by the forelimbs of primates when climbing vertical surfaces They can travel with cyclical tripedal gaits when climbing == Taxonomy == === Origins and evolution === Psittaciform diversity in South America and Australasia suggests that the order may have evolved in Gondwana centred in Australasia The scarcity of parrots in the fossil record however presents difficulties in confirming the hypothesis There is currently a higher amount of fossil remains from the northern hemisphere in the early Cenozoic Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 million years ago ( Mya ) ( range 66–51 Mya ) in Gondwana The three major clades of Neotropical parrots originated about 50 Mya ( range 57–41 Mya ) .A single 15 mm ( 0.6 in ) fragment from a large lower bill ( UCMP 143274 ) found in deposits from the Lance
/m/018p4k,A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads seat one to eight people have four wheels and mainly transport people ( rather than goods ) .Cars were invented in 1886 when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen Cars became widely available during the 20th century One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company Cars were rapidly adopted in the US where they replaced horse-drawn carriages In Europe and other parts of the world demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy Cars have controls for driving parking passenger comfort and a variety of lights Over the decades additional features and controls have been added to vehicles making them progressively more complex These include rear-reversing cameras air conditioning navigation systems and in-car entertainment Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels Electric cars which were invented early in the history of the car became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025 The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios such as Project Drawdown 's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle interest payments ( if the car is financed ) repairs and maintenance fuel depreciation driving time parking fees taxes and insurance The costs to society include maintaining roads land use road congestion air pollution public health healthcare and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide Personal benefits include on-demand transportation mobility independence and convenience Societal benefits include economic benefits such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry transportation provision societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities and revenue generation from taxes People 's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.There are around one billion cars in use worldwide Car usage is increasing rapidly especially in China India and other newly industrialized countries == Etymology == The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum `` wheeled vehicle '' or ( via Old North French ) Middle English carre `` two-wheeled cart '' both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros `` chariot '' It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle such as a cart carriage or wagon `` Motor car '' attested from 1895 is the usual formal term in British English `` Autocar '' a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning `` self-propelled car '' is now considered archaic `` Horseless carriage '' is attested from 1895 `` Automobile '' a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (
/m/0h8nm9j,A cat tree ( also referred to as a cat tree house cat condo kitty condo cat stand cat post `` catbox '' or cat tower ) is an artificial structure for a cat to play exercise relax and sleep on.Cat trees vary in height and complexity with most cats preferring features offering height over comfort particularly if tall enough to allow a clear survey of their territory Some cats prefer options which offer shelter or a secluded escape which may be at any height of the structure Conventional cat tree designs are of a floor-based solid structure composed of square-shaped sheets of particle board ( as platforms boxes and enclosed structures ) combined with wooden studs and planks ( used as elevators or stairs ) with exteriors and interiors typically covered with carpet Elevators are also frequently covered with an abrasive materials ( sisal rope being the most common ) intended to induce cats to scratch in those areas and reduce overall wear of the structure The levels created by the layer of interactive features offer cats anything from bedding and shelter to exercise and play There are specialized alternatives to the traditional cat tree that offer improved function for cats These alternative designs include wall-mounted pieces and sets as well as ergonomic designs and geometries that contour to feline anatomy Some designs simulate the shape or appearance of real trees Soft textiles and heavyweight fabrics have also replaced abrasive carpet in some of the more luxury-themed designs.Cat trees are meant to offer cats a sense of security by creating interactive areas that are only used by them While cat trees can help to deter cats from scratching on other furniture not every cat will react the same and cat owners have reported varied results in that regard Some companies are developing modern cat trees in stylish designs These cat trees combine the functions cats need such as stepped platforms and height with more visually appealing design such as exposed wood This more modern cat furniture is constructed to match a home 's décor == References ==
/m/0cydv,Caterpillars ( KAT-ər-pil-ər ) are the larval stage of members of the order Lepidoptera ( the insect order comprising butterflies and moths ) As with most common names the application of the word is arbitrary since the larvae of sawflies ( suborder Symphyta ) are commonly called caterpillars as well Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes Caterpillars of most species eat plant material ( often leaves ) but not all some ( about 1 % ) eat insects and some are even cannibalistic Some feed on other animal products For example clothes moths feed on wool and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates Caterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pests In fact many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm Conversely various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk as human or animal food or for biological control of pest plants == Etymology == The origins of the word `` caterpillar '' date from the early 16th century They derive from Middle English catirpel catirpeller probably an alteration of Old North French catepelose cate cat ( from Latin cattus ) + pelose hairy ( from Latin pilōsus ) .The inchworm or looper caterpillars from the family Geometridae are so named because of the way they move appearing to measure the earth ( the word geometrid means earth-measurer in Greek ) the primary reason for this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the prolegs except the clasper on the terminal segment == Description == Caterpillars have soft bodies that can grow rapidly between moults Their size varies between species and instars ( moults ) from as small as 1 millimetre ( 0.039 in ) up to 14 centimetres ( 5.5 in ) Some larvae of the order Hymenoptera ( ants bees and wasps ) can appear like the caterpillars of the Lepidoptera Such larvae are mainly seen in the sawfly suborder However while these larvae superficially resemble caterpillars they can be distinguished by the presence of prolegs on every abdominal segment an absence of crochets or hooks on the prolegs ( these are present on lepidopteran caterpillars ) one pair of prominent ocelli on the head capsule and an absence of the upside-down Y-shaped suture on the front of the head.Lepidopteran caterpillars can be differentiated from sawfly larvae by the numbers of pairs of pro-legs sawfly larvae have 6 or more pairs while caterpillars have a maximum of 5 pairs the number of stemmata ( simple eyes ) the sawfly larvae have only two while caterpillars usually have twelve ( six each side of the head ) the presence of crochets on the prolegs these are absent in the sawflies sawfly larvae have an invariably smooth head capsule with no cleavage lines while lepidopterous caterpillars bear an inverted `` Y '' or `` V '' ( adfrontal
/m/01xq0k1,A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders Scholars debate the scope of the word castle but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble This is distinct from a palace which is not fortified from a fortress which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility but not adequately fortified and from a fortified settlement which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction Use of the term has varied over time and has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles Over the approximately 900 years when genuine castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features although some such as curtain walls arrowslits and portcullises were commonplace European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community such as mills fertile land or a water source Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber but had their defences replaced later by stone Early castles often exploited natural defences lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep In the late 12th and early 13th centuries a scientific approach to castle defence emerged This led to the proliferation of towers with an emphasis on flanking fire Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle 's firepower These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades such as concentric fortification and inspiration from earlier defences such as Roman forts Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable

/m/01j4z9,A chainsaw ( or chain saw ) is a portable gasoline- electric- or battery-powered saw that cuts with a set of teeth attached to a rotating chain driven along a guide bar It is used in activities such as tree felling limbing bucking pruning cutting firebreaks in wildland fire suppression and harvesting of firewood Chainsaws with specially designed bar-and-chain combinations have been developed as tools for use in chainsaw art and chainsaw mills Specialized chainsaws are used for cutting concrete during construction developments Chainsaws are sometimes used for cutting ice for example ice sculpture and winter swimming in Finland == History == === In surgery === The origin of chain saws in surgery is debated A `` flexible saw '' consisting of a fine serrated link chain held between two wooden handles was pioneered in the late 18th century ( c. 1783–1785 ) by two Scottish doctors John Aitken and James Jeffray for symphysiotomy and excision of diseased bone respectively It was illustrated in the second edition of Aitken 's Principles of Midwifery or Puerperal Medicine ( 1785 ) in the context of a pelviotomy In 1806 Jeffray published Cases of the Excision of Carious Joints which collected a paper previously published by H. Park in 1782 and a translation of an 1803 paper by French physician P. F. Moreau with additional observations by Park and Jeffray In it Jeffray reported having conceived the idea of a saw `` with joints like the chain of a watch '' independently very soon after Park 's original 1782 publication but that he was not able to have it produced until 1790 after which it was used in the anatomy lab and occasionally lent out to surgeons Park and Moreau described successful excision of diseased joints particularly the knee and elbow and Jeffray explained that the chain saw would allow a smaller wound and protect the adjacent muscles nerves and veins While symphysiotomy had too many complications for most obstetricians Jeffray 's ideas about the excision of the ends of bones became more accepted especially after the widespread adoption of anaesthetics For much of the 19th century the chain saw was a useful surgical instrument but it was superseded in 1894 by the Gigli twisted-wire saw which was substantially cheaper to manufacture and gave a quicker narrower cut without risk of breaking and being entrapped in the bone.A precursor of the chainsaw familiar today in the timber industry was another medical instrument developed around 1830 by German orthopaedist Bernhard Heine This instrument the osteotome had links of a chain carrying small cutting teeth with the edges set at an angle the chain was moved around a guiding blade by turning the handle of a sprocket wheel As the name implies this was used to cut bone === For cutting wood === One of the earliest patents for an `` endless chain saw '' comprising a chain of links carrying saw teeth was granted to Frederick L.

/m/01mzpv,A chart ( sometimes known as a graph ) is a graphical representation for data visualization in which `` the data is represented by symbols such as bars in a bar chart lines in a line chart or slices in a pie chart '' A chart can represent tabular numeric data functions or some kinds of quality structure and provides different info The term `` chart '' as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings A data chart is a type of diagram or graph that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data Maps that are adorned with extra information ( map surround ) for a specific purpose are often known as charts such as a nautical chart or aeronautical chart typically spread over several map sheets Other domain-specific constructs are sometimes called charts such as the chord chart in music notation or a record chart for album popularity.Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data They are used in a wide variety of fields and can be created by hand ( often on graph paper ) or by computer using a charting application Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others For example data that presents percentages in different groups ( such as `` satisfied not satisfied unsure '' ) are often displayed in a pie chart but maybe more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart On the other hand data that represents numbers that change over a period of time ( such as `` annual revenue from 1990 to 2000 '' ) might be best shown as a line chart == Features == A chart can take a large variety of forms However there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data Typically the data in a chart is represented graphically since humans can infer meaning from pictures more quickly than from text Thus the text is generally used only to annotate the data One of the most important uses of text in a graph is the title A graph 's title usually appears above the main graphic and provides a succinct description of what the data in the graph refers to Dimensions in the data are often displayed on axes If a horizontal and a vertical axis are used they are usually referred to as the x-axis and y-axis Each axis will have a scale denoted by periodic graduations and usually accompanied by numerical or categorical indications Each axis will typically also have a label displayed outside or beside it briefly describing the dimension represented If the scale is numerical the label will often be suffixed with the unit of that scale in parentheses For example `` Distance traveled ( m ) '' is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled in units of meters is related to the horizontal position
/m/01nkt,Chess is a board game between two players It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi ( Chinese chess ) and shogi ( Japanese chess ) The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga a similar but much older game of Indian origin Today chess is one of the world 's most popular games played by millions of people worldwide Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid At the start each player controls sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns The player controlling the white pieces moves first followed by the player controlling the black pieces The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent 's king whereby the king is under immediate attack ( in `` check '' ) and there is no way for it to escape There are also several ways a game can end in a draw Organized chess arose in the 19th century Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE ( the International Chess Federation ) The first universally recognized World Chess Champion Wilhelm Steinitz claimed his title in 1886 Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game 's inception Aspects of art are found in chess composition and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics computer science and psychology One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine In 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov Today 's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory == Rules == The rules of chess are published by FIDE ( Fédération Internationale des Échecs ) chess 's international governing body in its Handbook Rules published by national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc. may differ in some details FIDE 's rules were most recently revised in 2023 === Setup === Chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets While the sets might not be literally white and black ( e.g the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color the dark set may be brown or red ) they are always referred to as `` white '' and `` black '' The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black respectively Each set consists of sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles for competition the Staunton pattern is preferred The game is played on a square board of eight rows ( called ranks )

/m/05kyg_,A chest of drawers also called ( especially in North American English ) a dresser or a bureau is a type of cabinet ( a piece of furniture ) that has multiple parallel horizontal drawers generally stacked one above another In American English a dresser is a piece of furniture usually waist high that has drawers and normally room for a mirror In British English a dresser or a Welsh dresser has shelves in the upper section for storing or displaying tableware.Chests of drawers have traditionally been made and used for storing clothing especially underwear socks and other items not normally hung in or otherwise stored in a closet They are usually placed in a bedroom for this purpose but can actually be used to store anything that will fit inside and can be placed anywhere in a house or another place Various personal sundry items are also often stored in a chest of drawers It has a long history as one of the stand-bys of a carpenter 's workshop A typical chest is approximately rectangular in overall shape and often has short legs at the bottom corners for placement on the floor Chests of drawers often come in 5- 6- and 7-drawer varieties with either a single or a double top drawer The chest illustrated at right would be described as a 5 over 2 chest-on-chest the latter term deriving from the fact that at one time it would have been made as 2 separable pieces They are commonly made of wood similar to many other kinds of furniture but of course can be made of other materials The inside of the drawers can be accessed by pulling them out at the front side It is often placed so that the back side faces a wall since access to the back is not necessary The lateral sides are also usually made such that they can be placed against a wall or in a corner Although they can be plain in appearance chests of drawers can also be made with a fancy or ornamental appearance including finishes and various external color tones Traditionally drawers would slide out on smooth wood rails Most modern cabinets ( such as Filing cabinets ) use roll-out shelf sliders made of metal with rollers.Most chests of drawers fall into one of two types those which are about waist-high or bench-high and those ( usually with more drawers ) which are about shoulder-high Both types typically have a flat surface on top Waist-high chests often have a mirror placed vertically on top which is often bought with the piece While a user is getting dressed or otherwise preparing their grooming he or she can look at themselves in the mirror to check their appearance A chifforobe ( from chiffonier + wardrobe ) is a combination of a wardrobe and a chest of drawers == History == First invented in China by Physician Hua Tuo “ 華佗 “ 180–208 CE The chest of drawers were often used for storing different types of medicine and called `` Hundred Drawers ''
/m/09b5t,The chicken ( Gallus gallus domesticus ) is a domesticated junglefowl species with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird and a younger male may be called a cockerel A male that has been castrated is a capon An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food ( consuming both their meat and eggs ) and as pets Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting which is still practiced in some places Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018 up from more than 19 billion in 2011 There are more chickens in the world than any other bird There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth folklore and religion and in language and literature.Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia Southeast Asia and East Asia but the clade found in the Americas Europe the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent From ancient India the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC with the `` bird that gives birth every day '' having come from the land between Syria and Shinar Babylonia according to the annals of Thutmose III They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken is from Southeast Asia == Terminology == An adult male is a called a cock or ( in the United States ) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.Other terms are Biddy a newly hatched chicken Capon a castrated or neutered male chicken Chick a young chicken Chook a chicken ( Australia/New Zealand informal ) Cockerel a young male chicken less than a year old Dunghill fowl a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties Pullet a young female chicken less than a year old In the poultry industry a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age Yardbird a chicken ( southern United States dialectal ) Chicken may also mean a chick ( see for example Hen and Chicken Islands ) In fact chicken was originally a term only for an immature or at least young bird In older sources chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.In Australian or New Zealand vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species ( e.g `` a cooked chook '' or `` she keeps chooks '' ) which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently hatched bird Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster 's `` Sense 1b '' viz the young of any bird ==
/m/01_5g,Chopsticks ( Chinese 筷子 or 箸 Pinyin kuaizi or zhu ) are shaped pairs of equal-length sticks of Chinese origin that have been used as kitchen and eating utensils in most of East and Southeast Asia for over three millennia They are held in the dominant hand secured by fingers and wielded as extensions of the hand to pick up food First used by the Chinese chopsticks later spread to Tibet and other parts of Asia Chopsticks have become more accepted in connection with Asian food in the West especially in cities with significant Asian diaspora communities Chopsticks are smoothed and frequently tapered They are traditionally made of wood bamboo metal ivory and ceramics and in modern days increasingly available in non-traditional materials such as plastic stainless steel and even titanium Chopsticks are often seen as requiring practice and skill to master to be used as an eating utensil Although not as serious as before in some countries it is often frowned upon if used incorrectly == Origin and history == Chopsticks have been around and used since at least the Shang dynasty ( 1766–1122 BCE ) However the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that it is likely that chopsticks were also used in the preceding Xia dynasty and even the earlier Erlitou culture although finding archeological evidence from this era is incredibly difficult.The earliest evidence of chopsticks uncovered so far consists of six chopsticks made of bronze 26 centimeters ( 10 in ) long and 1.1 to 1.3 centimeters ( 0.43 to 0.51 in ) wide excavated from the Ruins of Yin near Anyang ( Henan ) These are dated roughly to 1200 BCE during the Shang dynasty They were supposed to have been used for cooking The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the Han Feizi a philosophical text written by Han Fei ( c. 280–233 BCE ) in the 3rd century BCE.The wide diffusion of chopsticks in the Chinese culture is sometimes attributed to the Confucian philosophy that emphasizes family harmony as the basis for civil order Confucius himself have allegedly said that knives are for warriors but chopsticks are for scholars and his successor Mencius is linked to the aphorism `` the honorable and upright man keeps well away from both the slaughterhouse and the kitchen… And he allows no knives on his table '' Confucius references to chopsticks in his Book of Rites suggests these items were widely known in the Warring States period ( c. 475–221 BC ) === As cooking utensils === The first chopsticks were used for cooking stirring the fire serving or seizing bits of food and not as eating utensils One reason was that before the Han dynasty millet was predominant in North China Korea and parts of Japan While chopsticks were used for cooking millet porridge was eaten with spoons at that time 29-35 The use of chopsticks in the kitchen continues to this day Ryōribashi ( 料理箸 ) are Japanese kitchen chopsticks used in Japanese cuisine They are used in the preparation of Japanese

W. Symonds & B B. Whineray and also in The Country Life Book of English Furniture by Edward T. Joy a table designed by E. W. Godwin in 1868 and made in large numbers by William Watt and Collinson and Lock is a coffee table If this is correct it may be one of the earliest made in Europe Other sources however list it only as `` table '' so this can not be stated categorically Far from being a low table this table was about twenty-seven inches high.Later coffee tables were designed as low tables and this idea may have come from the Ottoman Empire based on the tables in use in tea gardens However as the Anglo-Japanese style was popular in Britain throughout the 1870s and 1880s and low tables were common in Japan this seems to be an equally likely source for the concept of a long low table From the late 19th century onwards many coffee tables were subsequently made in earlier styles due to the popularity of revivalism so it is quite possible to find Louis XVI style coffee tables or Georgian style coffee tables but there seems to be no evidence of a table actually made as a coffee table before this time Joseph Aronson writing in 1938 defines a coffee table as a `` Low wide table now used before a sofa or couch There is no historical precedent ... '' suggesting that coffee tables were a late development in the history of furniture With the increasing availability of television sets from the 1950s onwards coffee tables really came into their own since they are low enough even with cups and glasses on them not to obstruct the view of the TV == See also == Coffee table book Nightstand Chabudai == References ==
/m/07xyvk,A coffeemaker coffee maker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee While there are many different types of coffeemakers the two most common brewing principles use gravity or pressure to move hot water through coffee grounds In the most common devices coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot a cooking pot in the kettle family Cold water is poured into a separate chamber which is then boiled and directed into the funnel and allowed to drip through the grounds under gravity This is also called automatic drip-brew Coffee makers that use pressure to force water through the coffee grounds are called espresso makers and they produce espresso coffee == Types == === Vacuum brewers === On August 27 1930 Inez H. Peirce of Chicago Illinois filed her patent for the first vacuum coffee maker that truly automated the vacuum brewing process while eliminating the need for a stovetop burner or liquid fuels === Cafetiere === A cafetiere ( coffee plunger French press in US English ) requires coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter as finer grounds will seep through the press filter and into the coffee.Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grounds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter coffee brewed with the cafetiere captures more of the coffee 's flavour and essential oils which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine 's paper filters As with drip-brewed coffee cafetiere coffee can be brewed to any strength by adjusting the amount of ground coffee which is brewed If the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing French pressed coffee left to stand can become `` bitter '' though this is an effect that many users of cafetiere consider beneficial For a 1⁄2-litre ( 0.11 imp gal 0.13 US gal ) cafetiere the contents are considered spoiled by some reports after around 20 minutes === Single-serve coffeemaker === The single-serve or single-cup coffeemaker had gained popularity by the 2000s == See also == Benjamin Thompson Caffè crema Cezve Coffee cup Coffee percolator Coffee pod Coffee preparation Coffee vending machine Coffeepot ( François-Thomas Germain ) ISSpresso – the first espresso coffee machine designed for use in space Moka pot Neapolitan flip coffee pot Trojan Room coffee pot == References == == External links == Media related to Coffeemaking implements at Wikimedia Commons
/m/043nyj,The pig ( Sus domesticus ) often called swine hog or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus is an omnivorous domesticated even-toed hoofed mammal It is variously considered a subspecies of Sus scrofa ( the wild boar or Eurasian boar ) or a distinct species The pig 's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m ( 3 to 6 ft ) and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350 kg ( 110 and 770 lb ) with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed Compared to other artiodactyls a pig 's head is relatively long and pointed Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous but pigs are omnivores like their wild relative Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds When used as livestock pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat called pork A group of pigs is called a passel a team or a sounder The animal 's bones hide and bristles are also used in products Pigs especially miniature breeds are kept as pets == Biology == The pig typically has a large head with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ The dental formula of adult pigs is 3.1.4.33.1.4.3 giving a total of 44 teeth The rear teeth are adapted for crushing In the male the canine teeth can form tusks which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.Four hoofed toes are on each foot with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight but the outer two also being used in soft ground.Most pigs have rather a bristled sparse hair covering on their skin although woolly-coated breeds such as the Mangalitsa exist.Pigs possess both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas Pigs however like other `` hairless '' mammals ( e.g elephants rhinos and mole-rats ) do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22 °C ( 61 to 72 °F ) At higher temperatures pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions such as protection from sunburn ecto-parasite control and scent-marking.Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom Mongooses honey badgers hedgehogs and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding These represent four separate independent mutations.Pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal bronchitis and pneumonia Pigs have a maximum life span of about 27 years === Genetics
/m/0ftb8,The common sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ) is a large annual forb of the genus Helianthus It is commonly grown as a crop for its edible oily seeds Apart from cooking oil production it is also used as livestock forage ( as a meal or a silage plant ) as bird food in some industrial applications and as an ornamental in domestic gardens Wild H. annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads The domestic sunflower however often possesses only a single large inflorescence ( flower head ) atop an unbranched stem The binomial name Helianthus annuus is derived from the Greek Helios 'sun and anthos 'flower while the epithet annuus means 'annual in Latin The plant was first domesticated in the Americas Sunflower seeds were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century where along with sunflower oil they became a widespread cooking ingredient With time bulk of industrial-scale production has shifted to Eastern Europe and ( as of 2020 ) Russia and Ukraine together produce over half of worldwide seed production == Description == The plant has an erect rough-hairy stem reaching typical heights of 3 metres ( 10 feet ) The tallest sunflower on record achieved 9.17 m ( 30 ft 1 in ) Sunflower leaves are broad coarsely toothed rough and mostly alternate those near the bottom are largest and commonly heart-shaped === Flower === The plant flowers in summer What is often called the `` flower '' of the sunflower is actually a `` flower head '' ( pseudanthium ) 7.5–12.5 centimetres ( 3–5 in ) wide of numerous small individual five-petaled flowers ( `` florets '' ) The outer flowers which resemble petals are called ray flowers Each `` petal '' consists of a ligule composed of fused petals of an asymmetrical ray flower They are sexually sterile and may be yellow red orange or other colors The spirally arranged flowers in the center of the head are called disk flowers These mature into fruit ( sunflower `` seeds '' ) Prairie sunflower ( H. petiolaris ) is similar in appearance to the wild common sunflower the scales in its central disk are tipped by white hairs ==== Heliotropism ==== A common misconception is that flowering sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky Although immature flower buds exhibit this behaviour the mature flowering heads point in a fixed ( and typically easterly ) direction throughout the day This old misconception was disputed in 1597 by the English botanist John Gerard who grew sunflowers in his famous herbal garden `` [ some ] have reported it to turn with the Sun the which I could never observe although I have endeavored to find out the truth of it '' The uniform alignment of sunflower heads in a field might give some people the false impression that the flowers are tracking the Sun This alignment results from heliotropism in an earlier development stage the young flower stage before full maturity of flower heads ( anthesis ) Young sunflowers orient themselves in the
/m/01m2v,A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method for computers since the 1970s supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s Keyboard keys ( buttons ) typically have a set of characters engraved or printed on them and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol However producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence While most keys produce characters ( letters numbers or symbols ) other keys ( such as the escape key ) can prompt the computer to execute system commands In a modern computer the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software the information sent to the computer the scan code tells it only which physical key ( or keys ) was pressed or released.In normal usage the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text numbers and symbols into application software such as a word processor web browser or social media app Touchscreens use virtual keyboards == History == While typewriters are the definitive ancestor of all key-based text entry devices the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives largely from the utility of two devices teleprinters ( or teletypes ) and keypunches It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts As early as the 1870s teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker tape The teleprinter in its more contemporary form was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed Earlier Herman Hollerith developed the first keypunch devices which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s.The keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape ( instead of paper ) and data output.The keyboard remained the primary most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984 By this time text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen However keyboards remain central to

/m/020lf,A computer mouse ( plural mice sometimes mouses ) is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968 Mice originally used two separate wheels to track movement across a surface one in the X-dimension and one in the Y Later the standard design shifted to utilize a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion Most modern mice use optical sensors that have no moving parts Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable many modern mice are cordless relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system In addition to moving a cursor computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as the selection of a menu item on a display Mice often also feature other elements such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels which enable additional control and dimensional input == Etymology == The earliest known written use of the term mouse in reference to a computer pointing device is in Bill English 's July 1965 publication `` Computer-Aided Display Control '' likely originating from its resemblance to the shape and size of a mouse a rodent with the cord resembling its tail The popularity of wireless mice without cords makes the resemblance less obvious According to Roger Bates a hardware designer under English the term also came about because the cursor on the screen was for some unknown reason referred to as `` CAT '' and was seen by the team as if it would be chasing the new desktop device.The plural for the small rodent is always `` mice '' in modern usage The plural for a computer mouse is either `` mice '' or `` mouses '' according to most dictionaries with `` mice '' being more common The first recorded plural usage is `` mice '' the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use and earlier uses include J. C. R. Licklider 's `` The Computer as a Communication Device '' of 1968 == History == === Stationary trackballs === The trackball a related pointing device was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called the Comprehensive Display System ( CDS ) Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service Benjamin 's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a `` roller ball '' for this purpose.The device was patented in 1947 but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built and the device was kept as a military secret.Another early trackball was built by Kenyon Taylor a British electrical engineer

/m/02ctlc,A cricket bat is a specialised piece of equipment used by batters in the sport of cricket to hit the ball typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted willow-wood blade It may also be used by a batter who is making ground to avoid a run out by holding the bat and touching the ground with it The length of the bat may be no more than 38 inches ( 96.5 cm ) and the width no more than 4.25 inches ( 10.8 cm ) Its use is first mentioned in 1624 Since 1979 a law change has provided that cricket bats can only be made from wood == Construction == The blade of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the reverse ( back ) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit The bat is traditionally made from willow wood specifically from a variety of white willow called cricket bat willow ( Salix alba var caerulea ) treated with raw ( unboiled ) linseed oil which has a protective function This variety of willow is used as it is very tough and shock-resistant not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at high speed while also being light in weight The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the user In 1900 Percy Stuart Surridge developed a reinforced toe.The blade is connected to a long cylindrical cane handle similar to that of a mid-20th-century tennis racquet by means of a splice The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break at the corner of the join The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat 's blade to the handle and avoids this problem The edges of the blade closest to the handle are known as the shoulders of the bat and the bottom of the blade is known as the toe of the bat Bats were not always this shape Before the 18th century bats tended to be shaped similarly to a modern hockey sticks This may well have been a legacy of the game 's reputed origins Although the first forms of cricket are obscure it may be that the game was first played using shepherd 's crooks The bat generally recognised as the oldest bat still in existence is dated 1729 and is on display in the Sandham Room at The Oval in London == Maintenance == When first purchased most bats are not ready for immediate use and require knocking-in to allow the soft fibres to strike a hard new cricket
/m/09f_2,Crocodiles ( family Crocodylidae ) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa Asia the Americas and Australia The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia which includes the alligators and caimans ( family Alligatoridae ) the gharial and false gharial ( family Gavialidae ) among other extinct taxa Although they appear similar crocodiles alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families The gharial with its narrow snout is easier to distinguish while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit Also when the crocodile 's mouth is closed the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw For hard-to-distinguish specimens the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species family Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt which are present but non-functioning in alligators Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.Crocodile size morphology behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species However they have many similarities in these areas as well All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers lakes wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater They are carnivorous animals feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish reptiles birds and mammals and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans depending on species and age All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators are very sensitive to cold They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch about 55 million years ago Many species are at the risk of extinction some being classified as critically endangered == Etymology == The word crocodile comes from the Ancient Greek krokódilos ( κροκόδιλος ) meaning 'lizard used in the phrase ho krokódilos tou potamoú `` the lizard of the ( Nile ) river '' There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested including the later form krokódeilos ( κροκόδειλος ) found cited in many English reference works In the Koine Greek of Roman times krokodilos and krokodeilos would have been pronounced identically and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodīlus used by the ancient Romans It has been suggested but it is not certain that the word crocodilos or crocodeilos is a compound of krokè ( 'pebbles ) and drilos/dreilos ( 'worm ) although
/m/015wgc,A croissant is a buttery flaky Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape the dough is layered with butter rolled and folded several times in succession then rolled into a thin sheet in a technique called laminating The process results in a layered flaky texture similar to a puff pastry Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian and French bakeries and pâtisseries The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough In the late 1970s the development of factory-made frozen preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor The croissant bakery notably the La Croissanterie chain was a French response to American-style fast food and as of 2008 30–40 % of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries == Origin and history == The kipferl the origin of croissant can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria and came in various shapes The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings ( some consider the rugelach a form of kipferl ) .The birth of the croissant itself—that is its adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl before the invention of viennoiseries—can be dated to at least 1839 ( some say 1838 ) when an Austrian artillery officer August Zang founded a Viennese bakery ( `` Boulangerie Viennoise '' ) at 92 rue de Richelieu in Paris This bakery which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf quickly became popular and inspired French imitators ( and the concept if not the term of viennoiserie a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries ) The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent ( croissant ) shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.Sylvain Claudius Goy a French chef was the first to make croissant with yeast leavened laminated dough.Alan Davidson editor of the Oxford Companion to Food found no printed recipe for the present-day croissant in any French recipe book before the early 20th century the earliest French reference to a croissant he found was among the `` fantasy or luxury breads '' in Payen 's Des substances alimentaires 1853 However early recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate but the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards and was mentioned in several works of the time `` This same M.

/m/0nl46,A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars usually perpendicular to each other The lines usually run vertically and horizontally A cross of oblique lines in the shape of the Latin letter X is termed a saltire in heraldic terminology The cross has been widely recognized as a symbol of Christianity from an early period However the use of the cross as a religious symbol predates Christianity in the ancient times it was a pagan religious symbol throughout Europe and western Asia The effigy of a man hanging on a cross was set up in the fields to protect the crops It often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval to signify the sacred marriage as in Egyptian amulet Nefer with male cross and female orb considered as an amulet of blessedness a charm of sexual harmony == Name == The word cross is recorded in 11th-century Old English as cros exclusively for the instrument of Christ 's crucifixion replacing the native Old English word rood The word 's history is complicated it appears to have entered English from Old Irish possibly via Old Norse ultimately from the Latin crux ( or its accusative crucem and its genitive crucis ) `` stake cross '' The English verb to cross arises from the noun c. 1200 first in the sense `` to make the sign of the cross '' the generic meaning `` to intersect '' develops in the 15th century The Latin word was however influenced by popular etymology by a native Germanic word reconstructed as * krukjo ( English crook Old English crycce Old Norse krokr Old High German krucka ) This word by conflation with Latin crux gave rise to Old French crocier ( modern French crosse ) the term for a shepherd 's crook adopted in English as crosier Latin crux referred to the gibbet where criminals were executed a stake or pole with or without transom on which the condemned were impaled or hanged but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage The derived verb cruciāre means `` to put to death on the cross '' or more frequently `` to put to the rack to torture torment '' especially in reference to mental troubles In the Roman world furca replaced crux as the name of some cross-like instruments for lethal and temporary punishment ranging from a forked cross to a gibbet or gallows.The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of crux A crux can be of various shapes from a single beam used for impaling or suspending ( crux simplex ) to the various composite kinds of cross ( crux compacta ) made from more beams than one The latter shapes include not only the traditional †-shaped cross ( the crux immissa ) but also the T-shaped cross ( the crux commissa or tau cross ) which the descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross indicate as the normal form in use at that time and the
/m/05441v,A clutch is a mechanical device that engages and disengages power transmission especially from a drive shaft to a driven shaft In the simplest application clutches connect and disconnect two rotating shafts ( drive shafts or line shafts ) In these devices one shaft is typically attached to an engine or other power unit ( the driving member ) while the other shaft ( the driven member ) provides output power for work Typically the motions involved are rotary but linear clutches also exist In a motor vehicle the clutch acts as a mechanical linkage between the engine and transmission and briefly disconnects or separates the engine from the transmission system This disconnects the drive wheels whenever the clutch pedal is depressed allowing the driver to smoothly change gears In a torque-controlled drill for instance one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a drill chuck The clutch connects the two shafts so they may be locked together and spin at the same speed ( engaged ) locked together but spinning at different speeds ( slipping ) or unlocked and spinning at different speeds ( disengaged ) == TYPES == === Dry clutch === A dry clutch uses dry friction to transfer power from the input shaft to the output shaft The majority of clutches are dry clutches Slippage of a friction clutch ( where the clutch is partially engaged but the shafts are rotating at different speeds ) is sometimes required such as when a motor vehicle accelerates from a standstill however the slippage should be minimised to avoid increased wear rates In a pull-type clutch pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing to disengage the clutch In a push-type clutch pressing the pedal pushes the release bearing to disengage the clutch A multi-plate clutch consists of several friction plates arranged concentrically and is sometimes used in order to reduce the diameter of the clutch or to provide different 'stages of slippage ( for example in a drag racing car ) to control the rate at which the engine 's torque is transferred to the wheels during acceleration from a standing start ==== Materials ==== A common friction material is an organic compound resin with a copper wire facing or a ceramic material Ceramic materials can often transmit higher torque loads but they can cause increased wear rates of the flywheel Until the mid 1990s asbestos was also used in clutch plates ==== Spring centres and clutch dampers ==== A clutch disc can include springs which are designed to change the natural frequency of the clutch disc in order to reduce vibration or audible rattling from the gearbox when the engine is idling in neutral A clutch damper is a device that softens the response of the clutch engagement/disengagement In automotive applications this is often provided by a mechanism in the clutch disc centre === Wet clutch === In a wet clutch the friction material sits in an oil bath ( or has flow-through oil ) which cools and lubricates the clutch This can provide smoother engagement and
/m/015x4r,Cucumber ( Cucumis sativus ) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae family that bears usually cylindrical fruits which are used as culinary vegetables Considered an annual plant there are three main varieties of cucumber—slicing pickling and seedless—within which several cultivars have been created The cucumber originates from South Asia but now grows on most continents as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market In North America the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah though the two are not closely related == Description == The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames wrapping around supports with thin spiraling tendrils The plant may also root in a soilless medium whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical but elongated with tapered ends and may be as large as 62 centimeters ( 24 in ) long and 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) in diameter.Cucumber fruits consist of 95 % water ( see nutrition table ) In botanical terms the cucumber is classified as a pepo a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions However much like tomatoes and squashes it is often perceived prepared and eaten as a vegetable === Flowering and pollination === Most cucumber cultivars are seeded and require pollination For this purpose thousands of honey beehives are annually carried to cucumber fields just before bloom Cucumbers may also be pollinated via bumblebees and several other bee species Most cucumbers that require pollination are self-incompatible thus requiring the pollen of another plant in order to form seeds and fruit Some self-compatible cultivars exist that are related to the 'Lemon cultivar.A few cultivars of cucumber are parthenocarpic the blossoms of which create seedless fruit without pollination which degrades the eating quality of these cultivar In the United States these are usually grown in greenhouses where bees are excluded In Europe they are grown outdoors in some regions where bees are likewise excluded.Traditional cultivars produce male blossoms first then female in about equivalent numbers Newer gynoecious hybrid cultivars produce almost all female blossoms They may have a pollenizer cultivar interplanted and the number of beehives per unit area is increased but temperature changes induce male flowers even on these plants which may be sufficient for pollination to occur.In 2009 an international team of researchers announced they had sequenced the cucumber genome == Nutrition aroma and taste == Raw cucumber ( with peel ) is 95 % water 4 % carbohydrates 1 % protein and contains negligible fat A 100-gram ( 3+1⁄2-ounce ) reference serving provides 65 kilojoules ( 16 kilocalories ) of food energy It has a low content of micronutrients it is notable only for vitamin K at 16 % of the Daily Value ( table ) Depending on variety cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma

Stevens who was a food concessionaire The claim is that while working at the New York Polo Grounds in 1901 he came upon the idea of using small French rolls to hold the sausages when the waxed paper they were using ran out.A German immigrant named Feuchtwanger from Frankfurt in Hesse allegedly pioneered the practice in the American Midwest there are several versions of the story with varying details According to one account Feuchtwanger 's wife proposed the use of a bun in 1880 Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of St. Louis Missouri and provided gloves to

/m/09kx5,Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae They are classified as caniforms or doglike carnivorans Although only eight species of bears are extant they are widespread appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere Bears are found on the continents of North America South America Europe and Asia Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs long snouts small rounded ears shaggy hair plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws and short tails While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young bears are typically solitary animals They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell Despite their heavy build and awkward gait they are adept runners climbers and swimmers Bears use shelters such as caves and logs as their dens most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation up to 100 days Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment such as being made to dance With their powerful physical presence they play a prominent role in the arts mythology and other cultural aspects of various human societies In modern times bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts including the Asian bile bear market The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered and even least concern species such as the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain countries The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited but still ongoing == Etymology == The English word `` bear '' comes from Old English bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in Germanic languages such as Swedish björn also used as a first name This form is conventionally said to be related to a Proto-Indo-European word for `` brown '' so that `` bear '' would mean `` the brown one '' However Ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible a word meaning `` brown '' of this form can not be found in Proto-Indo-European He suggests instead that `` bear '' is from the Proto-Indo-European word * ǵʰwḗr- ~ * ǵʰwér `` wild animal '' This terminology for the animal originated as a taboo avoidance term proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear—arkto—with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal 's true name might cause it to appear According to author Ralph Keyes this is the oldest known euphemism.Bear taxon names such as Arctoidea and Helarctos come from the ancient Greek ἄρκτος ( arktos ) meaning bear as do the names `` arctic '' and `` antarctic '' via the name of the constellation Ursa Major the `` Great Bear '' prominent in the northern sky.Bear taxon names such as Ursidae
/m/0270h,A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or `` cold deserts '' Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls by the temperature that prevails by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces Although rain seldom occurs in deserts there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind This picks up particles of sand and dust which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface Rocks are smoothed down and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes Other deserts are flat stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones often forming desert pavements and little further erosion takes place Other desert features include rock outcrops exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate There may be underground sources of water in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers Where these are found oases can occur Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves water-resistant cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory Some annual plants germinate bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day They tend to be efficient at conserving water extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods ready to become active again during the rare rainfall They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life The cultivation of semi-arid

/m/0ky7b,A dishwasher is a machine that is used to clean dishware cookware and cutlery automatically Unlike manual dishwashing which relies heavily on physical scrubbing to remove soiling the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water typically between 45 and 75 °C ( 110 and 170 °F ) at the dishes with lower temperatures of water used for delicate items.A mix of water and dishwasher detergent is pumped to one or more rotating sprayers cleaning the dishes with the cleaning mixture The mixture is recirculated to save water and energy Often there is a pre-rinse which may or may not include detergent and the water is then drained This is followed by the main wash with fresh water and detergent Once the wash is finished the water is drained more hot water enters the tub by means of an electromechanical solenoid valve and the rinse cycle ( s ) begin After the rinse process finishes the water is drained again and the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods Typically a rinse-aid a chemical to reduce the surface tension of the water is used to reduce water spots from hard water or other reasons.In addition to domestic units industrial dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants where many dishes must be cleaned Washing is conducted with temperatures of 65–71 °C ( 149–160 °F ) and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide an 82 °C ( 180 °F ) `` final rinse '' temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer == History == The first mechanical dishwashing device was registered for a patent in 1850 in the United States by Joel Houghton This device was made of wood and was cranked by hand while water sprayed onto the dishes The device was both slow and unreliable Another patent was granted to L.A. Alexander in 1865 that was similar to the first but featured a hand-cranked rack system Neither device was practical or widely accepted Some historians cite as an obstacle to adoption the historical attitude that valued women for the effort put into housework rather than the results—making household chores easier was perceived by some to reduce their value.The most successful of the hand-powered dishwashers was invented in 1886 by Josephine Cochrane together with mechanic George Butters in Cochrane 's tool shed in Shelbyville Illinois when Cochrane ( a wealthy socialite ) wanted to protect her china while it was being washed Their invention was unveiled at the 1893 World 's Fair in Chicago under the name of Lavadora but was changed to Lavaplatos as another machine invented in 1858 already held that name Cochrane 's inspiration was her frustration at the damage to her good china that occurred when her servants handled it during cleaning Europe 's first domestic dishwasher with an electric motor was invented and manufactured by Miele in 1929.In the United Kingdom William Howard Livens invented a small non-electric dishwasher suitable for domestic use in 1924 It was the first dishwasher that

Stone patented the modern drinking straw 8 1/2 inches long and made of paper in 1888 to address the shortcomings of the rye grass straw He came upon the idea while drinking a mint julep on a hot day in Washington D.C. the taste of the rye grass straw was mixing with the drink and giving it a grassy taste which he found unsatisfactory He wound paper around a pencil to make a thin tube slid out the pencil from one end and applied glue between the strips He later refined it by building a machine that would coat the outside of the paper with wax to hold it together so the glue would not dissolve in bourbon.Early paper straws had a narrow bore to prevent seeds from clogging them It was common to use two of them to reduce the effort needed to take each sip === Mass production === Plastic straws became widespread following World War II The materials used in their manufacture were inexpensive and the types of restaurant fare that they accompanied had become more affordable and popular.In 1930 Otto W.

/m/04h8sr,The dumbbell a type of free weight is a piece of equipment used in weight training It is usually used individually or in pairs with one in each hand == History == The forerunner of the dumbbell halteres were used in ancient Greece as lifting weights and also as weights in the ancient Greek version of the long jump A kind of dumbbell was also used in India for more than a millennium shaped like a club – so it was named Indian club The design of the `` Nal '' as the equipment was referred to can be seen as a halfway point between a barbell and a dumbbell It was generally used in pairs in workouts by wrestlers bodybuilders sports players and others wishing to increase strength and muscle size == Etymology == The term `` dumbbell '' or `` dumb bell '' originated in late Stuart England In 1711 the poet Joseph Addison mentioned exercising with a `` dumb bell '' in an essay published in The Spectator.Although Addison elsewhere in the same publication describes having used equipment similar to the modern understanding of dumbbells according to sport historian Jan Todd the form of the first dumbbells remains unclear The Oxford English Dictionary describes `` apparatus similar to that used to ring a church bell but without the bell so noiseless or ‘ dumb ’ '' implying the action of pulling a bell rope to practice English bellringing == Types == By the early 17th century the familiar shape of the dumbbell with two equal weights attached to a handle had appeared There are currently three main types of dumbbell Fixed-weight dumbbells are weights created in a dumbbell shape Inexpensive varieties consist of cast iron sometimes coated with rubber or neoprene for comfort and even cheaper versions consist of a rigid plastic shell that is filled with concrete Adjustable dumbbells consist of a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern ( knurling ) to improve grip Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars Shown to the right is a `` spinlock '' dumbbell whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars Alternatively a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar Plate-loaded ( adjustable ) dumbbells ( a.k.a loadable dumbbells ) Spin-lock Spring collar clips Compression ring collar Ironmaster quick-lock '' Selectorized '' ( adjustable ) dumbbells are adjustable dumbbells whose number of plates ( i.e weight ) can be easily changed when resting in the dumbbell stand This is achieved by adjusting the number of plates that follow the handle when lifted e.g by turning a dial or moving a selector pin rather than manually adding or removing plates This makes it very easy to change the weight of the dumbbell between exercises and the stand typically doubles as storage for the additional weights not being used for a particular exercise There are different types of mechanism Block type Dial type Glide type Twist type 2-in-1
/m/09csl,Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae Eagles belong to several groups of genera some of which are closely related Most of the 68 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa Outside this area just 14 species can be found—2 in North America 9 in Central and South America and 3 in Australia Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable ( about 50 cm long or more overall ) vertebrates == Description == Eagles are large powerfully-built birds of prey with heavy heads and beaks Even the smallest eagles such as the booted eagle ( Aquila pennata ) which is comparable in size to a common buzzard ( Buteo buteo ) or red-tailed hawk ( B. jamaicensis ) have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings and more direct faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle ( Spilornis klossi ) at 450 g ( 1 lb ) and 40 cm ( 16 in ) The largest species are discussed below Like all birds of prey eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey strong muscular legs and powerful talons The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey Eagles eyes are extremely powerful It is estimated that the martial eagle whose eyes are more than two times larger than the human eye has a visual acuity up to 8 times that of humans This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction ( scattering ) of the incoming light The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.Eagles normally build their nests called eyries in tall trees or on high cliffs Many species lay two eggs but the older larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched The parents take no action to stop the killing It is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true Eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds pressure This saves the bird 's energy Due to the size and power of many eagle species they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world The type of prey varies by genus The Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish though the species in the former often capture various animals especially other water birds and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus Terathopius and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can
/m/01r546,An earring is a piece of jewelry attached to the ear via a piercing in the earlobe or another external part of the ear ( except in the case of clip earrings which clip onto the lobe ) Earrings have been worn by people in different civilizations and historic periods often with cultural significance Locations for piercings other than the earlobe include the rook tragus and across the helix ( see image at right ) The simple term `` ear piercing '' usually refers to an earlobe piercing whereas piercings in the upper part of the external ear are often referred to as `` cartilage piercings '' Cartilage piercings are more complex to perform than earlobe piercings and take longer to heal.Earring components may be made of any number of materials including metal plastic glass precious stone beads wood bone and other materials Designs range from small hoops and studs to large plates and dangling items The size is ultimately limited by the physical capacity of the earlobe to hold the earring without tearing However heavy earrings worn over extended periods of time may lead to stretching of the earlobe and the piercing == History == Ear piercing is one of the oldest known forms of body modification with artistic and written references from cultures around the world dating back to early history Gold earrings along with other jewelry made of gold lapis lazuli and carnelian were found in the ancient sites in Lothal India and Sumerian Royal Cemetery at Ur from the Early Dynastic period Gold silver and bronze hoop earrings were prevalent in the Minoan Civilization ( 2000–1600 BCE ) and examples can be seen on frescoes on the Aegean island of Santorini Greece During the late Minoan and early Mycenaean periods of Bronze Age Greece hoop earrings with conical pendants were fashionable Early evidence of earrings worn by men can be seen in archeological evidence from Persepolis in ancient Persia The carved images of soldiers of the Persian Empire displayed on some of the surviving walls of the palace show them wearing an earring Howard Carter writes in his description of Tutankhamun 's tomb that the Pharaoh 's earlobes were perforated but no earrings were inside the wrappings although the tomb contained some The burial mask 's ears were perforated as well but the holes were covered with golden discs That implies that at the time earrings were only worn in Egypt by children much like in Egypt of Carter 's times Other early evidence of earring-wearing is evident in the Biblical record In Exodus 32:1–4 it is written that while Moses was up on Mount Sinai the Israelites demanded that Aaron make a god for them It is written that he commanded them to bring their sons and daughters earrings ( and other pieces of jewelry ) to him in order that he might comply with their demand ( c. 1500 BCE ) By the classical period including in the Middle East as a general rule they were considered exclusively female ornaments During certain periods in Greece and
/m/033cnk,An egg is an organic vessel grown by an animal to carry a possibly fertilized egg cell ( a zygote ) and to incubate from it an embryo within the egg until the embryo has become an animal fetus that can survive on its own at which point the animal hatches Most arthropods such as insects vertebrates ( excluding live-bearing mammals ) and mollusks lay eggs although some such as scorpions do not Reptile eggs bird eggs and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell either flexible or inflexible Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches i.e. breaks out of the egg 's shell Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack pip or break the eggshell or covering The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was 30 cm × 14 cm × 9 cm ( 11.8 in × 5.5 in × 3.5 in ) in size Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother At 1.5 kg ( 3.3 lb ) and up to 17.8 cm × 14 cm ( 7.0 in × 5.5 in ) the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird though the extinct elephant bird and some non-avian dinosaurs laid larger eggs The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg which weighs half of a gram ( around 0.02 oz ) Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish amphibians insects and other invertebrates can be even smaller Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed `` spores '' or in spermatophytes `` seeds '' or in gametophytes `` egg cells '' == Eggs of different animal groups == Several major groups of animals typically have readily distinguishable eggs === Fish and amphibian eggs === The most common reproductive strategy for fish is known as oviparity in which the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male Typically large numbers of eggs are laid at one time ( an adult female cod can produce 4–6 million eggs in one spawning ) and the eggs are then left to develop without parental care When the larvae hatch from the egg they often carry the remains of the yolk in a yolk sac which continues to nourish the larvae for a few days as they learn how to swim Once the yolk is consumed there is a critical point after which they must learn how to hunt and feed or they will die A few fish notably the rays and most sharks use ovoviviparity in which the eggs are fertilized and develop internally However the larvae still grow inside the egg consuming the egg 's yolk and without any direct nourishment from the mother The mother then gives birth to relatively mature young In certain instances the physically most developed offspring will devour its smaller siblings for further nutrition while still within the mother

/m/0frqm,An envelope is a common packaging item usually made of thin flat material It is designed to contain a flat object such as a letter or card Traditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes a rhombus a short-arm cross or a kite These shapes allow the envelope structure to be made by folding the sheet sides around a central rectangular area In this manner a rectangle-faced enclosure is formed with an arrangement of four flaps on the reverse side == Overview == A folding sequence such that the last flap closed is on a short side is referred to in commercial envelope manufacture as a pocket – a format frequently employed in the packaging of small quantities of seeds Although in principle the flaps can be held in place by securing the topmost flap at a single point ( for example with a wax seal ) generally they are pasted or gummed together at the overlaps They are most commonly used for enclosing and sending mail ( letters ) through a prepaid-postage postal system Window envelopes have a hole cut in the front side that allows the paper within to be seen They are generally arranged so that the receiving address printed on the letter is visible saving duplication of the address on the envelope itself The window is normally covered with a transparent or translucent film to protect the letter inside as was first designed by Americus F. Callahan in 1901 and patented the following year In some cases shortages of materials or the need to economize resulted in envelopes that had no film covering the window One innovative process invented in Europe about 1905 involved using hot oil to saturate the area of the envelope where the address would appear The treated area became sufficiently translucent for the address to be readable As of 2009 there is no international standard for window envelopes but some countries including Germany and the United Kingdom have national standards.An aerogram is related to a letter sheet both being designed to have writing on the inside to minimize the weight Any handmade envelope is effectively a letter sheet because prior to the folding stage it offers the opportunity for writing a message on that area of the sheet that after folding becomes the inside of the face of the envelope For document security the letter sheet can be sealed with wax Another secure form of letter sheet is a locked letter that is formed by cutting and folding the sheet in an elaborate way that prevents the letter from being opened without creating obvious damage to the letter/envelope The `` envelope '' used to launch the Penny Post component of the British postal reforms of 1840 by Sir Rowland Hill and the invention of the postage stamp was a lozenge-shaped lettersheet known as a Mulready If desired a separate letter could be enclosed with postage remaining at one penny provided the combined weight did not exceed half an ounce ( 14 grams ) This was a legacy of

/m/0f6wt,Falcons ( ) are birds of prey in the genus Falco which includes about 40 species Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.Adult falcons have thin tapered wings which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly Fledgling falcons in their first year of flying have longer flight feathers which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broad wing This makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species All these birds kill with their beaks using a tomial `` tooth '' on the side of their beaks—unlike the hawks eagles and other birds of prey in the Accipitridae which use their feet The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm in length The smallest falcon species is the Pygmy falcon which measures just 20 cm As with hawks and owls falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism with the females typically larger than the males thus allowing a wider range of prey species.Some small falcons with long narrow wings are called `` hobbies '' and some which hover while hunting are called `` kestrels '' .As is the case with many birds of prey falcons have exceptional powers of vision the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of a normal human Peregrine falcons have been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h ( 200 mph ) making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h ( 240 mph ) == Taxonomy == The genus Falco was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae The type species is the Merlin ( Falco columbarius ) The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning a `` falcon '' from falx falcis meaning `` a sickle '' referring to the claws of the bird In Middle English and Old French the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor species.The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel ( British spelling ) or tiercel ( American spelling ) from the Latin tertius ( third ) because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than a female ( Old French tiercelet ) A falcon chick especially one reared for falconry still in its downy stage is known as an eyas ( sometimes spelled eyass ) The word arose by mistaken division of Old French un niais from Latin presumed nidiscus ( nestling ) from nidus ( nest ) The technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry Compared to other birds of prey the fossil record of

/m/0306r,A box ( plural boxes ) is a container used for the storage or transportation of its contents Most boxes have flat parallel rectangular sides Boxes can be very small ( like a matchbox ) or very large ( like a shipping box for furniture ) and can be used for a variety of purposes from functional to decorative Boxes may be made of a variety of materials both durable such as wood and metal and non-durable such as corrugated fiberboard and paperboard Corrugated metal boxes are commonly used as shipping containers Most commonly boxes have flat parallel rectangular sides making them rectangular prisms but boxes may also have other shapes Rectangular prisms are often referred to colloquially as `` boxes '' Boxes may be closed and shut with flaps doors or a separate lid They can be secured shut with adhesives tapes or more decorative or elaborately functional mechanisms such as a catch clasp or lock == Types == === Packaging === Several types of boxes are used in packaging and storage A corrugated box is a shipping container made from corrugated fiberboard most commonly used to transport products from a warehouse during distribution Corrugated boxes are also known as cartons cases and cardboard boxes in various regions Corrugated boxes are rated based on the strength of their material or their carrying capacity Corrugated boxes are also used as product packaging or in point of sale displays Folding cartons ( sometimes known as a box ) are paperboard boxes manufactured with a folding lid These are used to package a wide range of goods and can be used for either one-time ( non-resealable ) usage or as a storage box for more permanent use Folding cartons are first printed ( if necessary ) before being die-cut and scored to form a blank these are then transported and stored flat before being constructed at the point of use A gift box is a variant on the folding carton used for birthday or Christmas gifts Gable boxes are paperboard cartons used for liquids Setup boxes ( also known as rigid paperboard boxes ) are made of stiff paperboard and are permanently glued together with paper skins that can be printed or colored Unlike folding cartons these are assembled at the point of manufacture and transported as already constructed ( `` set-up '' ) Set up boxes are more expensive than folding boxes and are typically used for protecting high-value items such as cosmetics watches or smaller consumer electronics Crates are heavy duty shipping containers Originally made of wood crates are distinct from wooden boxes also used as heavy-duty shipping containers as a wooden container must have all six of its sides put in place to result in the rated strength of the container The strength of a wooden box on the other hand is rated based on the weight it can carry before the top or opening is installed A wooden wine box or wine crate originally used for shipping and storing expensive wines is a variant of the wooden box now used
/m/0319l,The French horn ( since the 1930s known simply as the horn in professional music circles ) is a brass instrument made of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell The double horn in F/B♭ ( technically a variety of German horn ) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands although the descant and triple horn have become increasingly popular A musician who plays a horn is known as a horn player or hornist Pitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors speed of air through the instrument ( controlled by the player 's lungs and thoracic diaphragm ) diameter and tension of lip aperture ( by the player 's lip muscles—the embouchure ) in the mouthpiece plus in a modern horn the operation of valves by the left hand which route the air into extra sections of tubing Most horns have lever-operated rotary valves but some especially older horns use piston valves ( similar to a trumpet 's ) and the Vienna horn uses double-piston valves or pumpenvalves The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet A horn without valves is known as a natural horn changing pitch along the natural harmonics of the instrument ( similar to a bugle ) Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell in effect reducing the bell 's diameter The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell The key of a natural horn can be changed by adding different crooks of different lengths Three valves control the flow of air in the single horn which is tuned to F or less commonly B♭ The more common double horn has a fourth trigger valve usually operated by the thumb which routes the air to one set of tubing tuned to F or another tuned to B♭ which expands the horn range to over four octaves and blends with flutes or clarinets in a woodwind ensemble Triple horns with five valves are also made usually tuned in F B♭ and a descant E♭ or F. There are also double horns with five valves tuned in B♭ descant E♭ or F and a stopping valve which greatly simplifies the complicated and difficult hand-stopping technique though these are rarer Also common are descant doubles which typically provide B♭ and alto F branches A crucial element in playing the horn deals with the mouthpiece Most of the time the mouthpiece is placed in the exact center of the lips but because of differences in the formation of the lips and teeth of different players some tend to play with the mouthpiece slightly off center Although the exact side-to-side placement of the mouthpiece varies for most horn players the up-and-down placement of the mouthpiece is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip When playing higher notes the

/m/02xwb,In botany a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering Fruits are the means by which flowering plants ( also known as angiosperms ) disseminate their seeds Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other in fact humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food Consequently fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world 's agricultural output and some ( such as the apple and the pomegranate ) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings In common language usage fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures ( or produce ) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state such as apples bananas grapes lemons oranges and strawberries In botanical usage the term fruit also includes many structures that are not commonly called 'fruits in everyday language such as nuts bean pods corn kernels tomatoes and wheat grains == Botanical vs. culinary == Many common language terms used for fruit and seeds differ from botanical classifications For example in botany a fruit is a ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds e.g. an apple pomegranate tomato or a pumpkin A nut is a type of fruit ( and not a seed ) and a seed is a ripened ovule.In culinary language a fruit is the sweet- or not sweet- ( even sour- ) tasting produce of a specific plant ( e.g. a peach pear or lemon ) nuts are hard oily non-sweet plant produce in shells ( hazelnut acorn ) Vegetables so called typically are savory or non-sweet produce ( zucchini lettuce broccoli and tomato ) but some may be sweet-tasting ( sweet potato ) .Examples of botanically classified fruit that typically are called vegetables include cucumber pumpkin and squash ( all are cucurbits ) beans peanuts and peas ( all legumes ) corn eggplant bell pepper ( or sweet pepper ) and tomato The spices chili pepper and allspice are fruits botanically speaking In contrast rhubarb is often called a fruit when used in making pies but the edible produce of rhubarb is actually the leaf stalk or petiole of the plant Edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names e.g. ginkgo nuts and pine nuts Botanically a cereal grain such as corn rice or wheat is a kind of fruit ( termed a caryopsis ) However the fruit wall is thin and fused to the seed coat so almost all the edible grain-fruit is actually a seed == Structure == The outer layer often edible of most fruits is called the pericarp Typically formed from the ovary it surrounds the seeds in some species however other structural tissues contribute to or form the edible portion The pericarp may be described in three layers from outer to inner i.e. the epicarp mesocarp and endocarp Fruit that bears a prominent pointed terminal projection is said

/m/0cjs7,Asparagus or garden asparagus folk name sparrow grass scientific name Asparagus officinalis is a perennial flowering plant species in the genus Asparagus Its young shoots are used as a spring vegetable It was once classified in the lily family like the related Allium species onions and garlic However genetic research places lilies Allium and asparagus in three separate families—the Liliaceae Amaryllidaceae and Asparagaceae respectively— the Amaryllidaceae and Asparagaceae are grouped together in the order Asparagales Sources differ as to the native range of Asparagus officinalis but generally include most of Europe and western temperate Asia It is widely cultivated as a vegetable crop == Description == Asparagus is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 100–150 centimetres ( 40–60 inches ) tall with stout stems with much-branched feathery foliage The 'leaves are in fact needle-like cladodes ( modified stems ) in the axils of scale leaves they are 6–32 millimetres ( 1⁄4–1+1⁄4 inches ) long and 1 mm ( 1⁄32 in ) broad and clustered four to 15 together in a rose-like shape The root system often referred to as a 'crown is adventitious and the root type is fasciculated The flowers are bell-shaped greenish-white to yellowish 4.5–6.5 mm ( 3⁄16–1⁄4 in ) long with six tepals partially fused together at the base they are produced singly or in clusters of two or three in the junctions of the branchlets It is usually dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants but sometimes hermaphrodite flowers are found The fruit is a small red berry 6–10 mm ( 1⁄4–13⁄32 in ) in diameter which is toxic to humans.Plants native to the western coasts of Europe ( from northern Spain to northwest Germany north Ireland and Great Britain ) are treated as Asparagus officinalis subsp prostratus ( Dumort ) Corb. distinguished by its low-growing often prostrate stems growing to only 30–70 centimetres ( 12–28 in ) high and shorter cladodes 2–18 mm ( 3⁄32–23⁄32 in ) long It is treated as a distinct species Asparagus prostratus Dumort by some authors === Chemistry === Certain compounds in asparagus are metabolized to yield ammonia and various sulfur-containing degradation products including various thiols and thioesters which following consumption give urine a characteristic smell Some of the volatile organic compounds responsible for the smell are methanethiol dimethyl sulfide dimethyl disulfide bis ( methylthio ) methane dimethyl sulfoxide dimethyl sulfoneSubjectively the first two are the most pungent while the last two ( sulfur-oxidized ) give a sweet aroma A mixture of these compounds form a `` reconstituted asparagus urine '' odor This was first investigated in 1891 by Marceli Nencki who attributed the smell to methanethiol These compounds originate in the asparagus as asparagusic acid and its derivatives as these are the only sulfur-containing compounds unique to asparagus As these are more present in young asparagus this accords with the observation that the smell is more pronounced after eating young asparagus The biological mechanism for the production of these compounds is less clear.The onset of the asparagus urine smell is remarkably rapid while the decline is slower The smell
/m/02wv84t,"A gas stove is a stove that is fuelled by combustible gas such as syngas natural gas propane butane liquefied petroleum gas or other flammable gas Before the advent of gas cooking stoves relied on solid fuels such as coal or wood The first gas stoves were developed in the 1820s and a gas stove factory was established in England in 1836 This new cooking technology had the advantage of being easily adjustable and could be turned off when not in use The gas stove however did not become a commercial success until the 1880s by which time supplies of piped gas were available in cities and large towns in Britain The stoves became widespread on the European Continent and in the United States in the early 20th century Gas stoves became more common when the oven was integrated into the base and the size was reduced to better fit in with the rest of the kitchen furniture By the 1910s producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light This had the disadvantage of continually consuming gas The oven still needed to be lit by match and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion To prevent these types of accidents oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs ( cooktops ) and ovens Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition automatic timers for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes Gas stoves are a significant source of indoor air pollution and require good ventilation to maintain acceptable air quality and have been linked to significant increases in the rate of asthma in children although this link has been disputed in an earlier 2013 study Gas stoves also release methane Research in 2022 estimated that the methane emissions from gas stoves in the United States were equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions of 500,000 cars About 80 % of methane emissions were found to occur even when stoves are turned off as the result of tiny leaks in gas lines and fittings Although methane contains less carbon than other fuels gas venting and unintended fugitive emissions throughout the supply chain results in natural gas having a similar carbon footprint to other fossil fuels overall == History == The first gas stove was developed in 1802 by Zachäus Winzler ( de ) but this along with other attempts remained isolated experiments James Sharp patented a gas stove in Northampton England in 1826 and opened a gas stove factory in 1836 His invention was marketed by the firm Smith & Philips from 1828 An important figure in the early acceptance of this new technology was Alexis Soyer the renowned chef at the Reform Club in London From 1841 he converted his kitchen to consume piped gas arguing that gas was cheaper overall because the supply could be turned off when the stove was not in use.A gas stove was shown"

/m/05r655,Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material ( the fuel ) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion releasing heat light and various reaction products At a certain point in the combustion reaction called the ignition point flames are produced The flame is the visible portion of the fire Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide water vapor oxygen and nitrogen If hot enough the gases may become ionized to produce plasma Depending on the substances alight and any impurities outside the color of the flame and the fire 's intensity will be different.Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems Its negative effects include hazard to life and property atmospheric pollution and water contamination If fire removes protective vegetation heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water Also when vegetation is burned the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is `` fixed '' and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are `` nitrogen-fixing '' such as clover peas and green beans Fire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals in agriculture for clearing land for cooking generating heat and light for signaling propulsion purposes smelting forging incineration of waste cremation and as a weapon or mode of destruction == Physical properties == === Chemistry === Fire is a chemical process in which a fuel and an oxidizing agent react yielding carbon dioxide and water This process known as a combustion reaction does not proceed directly and involves intermediates Although the oxidizing agent is typically oxygen other compounds are able to fulfill the role For instance chlorine trifluoride is able to ignite sand.Fires start when a flammable or a combustible material in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound ( though non-oxygen oxidizers exist ) is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron Fire can not exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions For example a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst a substance that is not consumed when added in any chemical reaction during combustion but which enables the reactants to combust more readily Once ignited a chain
/m/0jyfg,"Glass is a non-crystalline often transparent amorphous solid that has widespread practical technological and decorative use in for example window panes tableware and optics Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling ( quenching ) of the molten form some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring The most familiar and historically the oldest types of manufactured glass are `` silicate glasses '' based on the chemical compound silica ( silicon dioxide or quartz ) the primary constituent of sand Soda–lime glass containing around 70 % silica accounts for around 90 % of manufactured glass The term glass in popular usage is often used to refer only to this type of material although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology Some objects such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material Despite being brittle buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia Egypt or Syria The earliest known glass objects were beads perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience Due to its ease of formability into any shape glass has been traditionally used for vessels such as bowls vases bottles jars and drinking glasses In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights and marbles Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass The refractive reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses prisms and optoelectronics materials Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic ( fibreglass ) == Microscopic structure == The standard definition of a glass ( or vitreous solid ) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching However the term `` glass '' is often defined in a broader sense to describe any non-crystalline ( amorphous ) solid that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state.Glass is an amorphous solid Although the atomic-scale structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure of a supercooled liquid glass exhibits all the mechanical properties of a solid As in other amorphous solids the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in crystalline solids Due to chemical bonding constraints glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over extended periods of time is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis ( see viscosity in solids ) Though a material viscosity on the order of 1017–1018 Pa s can be measured in glass such a high value reinforces the fact that glass would not change shape appreciably over even large periods of time === Formation from a supercooled liquid === For melt"

/m/05w9t9,Hair spray ( also hair lacquer or spritz ) is a common cosmetic hairstyling product that is sprayed onto hair to protect against humidity and wind Hair sprays typically consist of several components for the hair as well as a propellant == Ingredients and operation == Hair sprays consist of the following components concentrate plasticizers luster agents and fragrances as well as propellants === Concentrate === Hair spray are a blend of polymers that provide structural support to hair These frequently include copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) and polyvinyl acetate ( PVAc ) Vinyl acetate-crotonic acid copolymers give harder films In this way hairsprays can be formulated as flexible medium and maximum hold The copolymer mixture is usually adjusted to achieve the desired physical properties ( adhesive strength foaming etc ) using plasticizers such as aminomethyl propanol surfactants such as benzalkonium chloride and other agents like dimethicone === Propellants === Since the phase-out of CFCs in the 1980s hydrocarbons are popular propellants These include propane butane isobutane and related volatile hydrocarbons as well as other mixtures Such hydrocarbons are poor solvents for the active ingredients such as the polymers For this reason dimethyl ether is often added as well It functions both as a propellant and a solvent === Other components === Plasticizers used in hair spray include esters of citric acid and adipic acid Silicones and polyglycols are also used The concentrate comprises only a small volume of a can of hairspray Most of a canister is filled solvents such as isopropanol ( rubbing alcohol ) and ethanol == History == Early hair sprays were developed in Europe in the 1920s In the US hair sprays were developed around the time of the aerosol can in the 1940s and the first patents describing copolymers for hair styling were published in the 1940s.In the US the first to package it was Chase products ( an aerosol manufacturer ) in 1948 as the beauty industry saw that the aerosol cans used in World War II for insecticides could be used as a dispenser for hairspray It thrived and became increasingly popular and mass-produced as updos and other such hairstyles were created By 1964 it became the highest selling beauty product on the market In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a `` Freedom Trash Can '' These included hairspray which was among items the protestors called `` instruments of female torture '' and accoutrements of what they perceived to be enforced femininity Sales of hairspray declined in the 1970s as hairstyles became predominantly worn straight and loose By the 1980s hairspray ’ s popularity came back as big hairstyles resurged with the glam metal scene Prior to 1979 the most popular propellants in hairsprays were CFCs Owing to environmental concerns they were replaced Hair spray can be used for things other than hair For example in the beauty world one might spray some hairspray on the leg and on the inside of the dress so that the dress wo n't ride up
/m/0cdn1,A hamburger or simply burger is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll Hamburgers are often served with cheese lettuce tomato onion pickles bacon or chilis condiments such as ketchup mustard mayonnaise relish or a `` special sauce '' often a variation of Thousand Island dressing and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own especially in the United Kingdom where the term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef Since the term hamburger usually implies beef for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used as in beef burger turkey burger bison burger portobello burger or veggie burger In Australia and New Zealand a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires sliced bread ( not a bun ) so it would not be considered a sandwich.Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants diners and specialty and high-end restaurants There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers == Etymology and terminology == The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg the second-largest city in Germany however there is no certain connection between the food and the city ( see History below ) By back-formation the term `` burger '' eventually became a self-standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches similar to a ( ground meat ) hamburger but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger venison kangaroo chicken turkey elk lamb or fish like salmon in the salmon burger but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger == History == As versions of the meal have been served for over a century its origin remains ambiguous The 1758 edition of the book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as `` Hamburgh sausage '' which suggested to serve it `` roasted with toasted bread under it '' A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name `` Rundstück warm '' ( `` bread roll warm '' ) in 1869 or earlier and supposedly eaten by many emigrants on their way to America but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadeller It has been suggested that Hamburg steak served between two pieces of bread and frequently eaten by Jewish passengers travelling from Hamburg to New York on Hamburg America Line vessels ( which began operations in 1847 ) became so well known that the shipping company gave its name to the dish Each of these may mark the invention of the hamburger and explain the name There is a reference to a `` Hamburg steak
/m/03l9g,A hammer is a tool most often a hand tool consisting of a weighted `` head '' fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object This can be for example to drive nails into wood to shape metal ( as with a forge ) or to crush rock Hammers are used for a wide range of driving shaping breaking and non-destructive striking applications Traditional disciplines include carpentry blacksmithing warfare and percussive musicianship ( as with a gong ) Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity as opposed to prying with a secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm in a lengthy downward planar arc—downward to add kinetic energy to the impact—pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact for extreme impact concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc ( but this is tiring ) War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips which can also include a lunging motion especially against moving targets Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness and the handle ( also known as a haft or helve ) is typically made of wood or plastic Ubiquitous in framing the claw hammer has a `` claw '' to pull nails out of wood and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America Other types of hammers vary in shape size and structure depending on their purposes Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers mallets and ball-peen hammers Although most hammers are hand tools powered hammers such as steam hammers and trip hammers are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.For hand hammers the grip of the shaft is an important consideration Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration steel is also a good conductor of heat making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip dampen vibration and to provide thermal insulation A suitably contoured handle is
/m/0c3m8g,"A hand dryer is an electric machine which might make use of a heating element and an air blower to dry the hands after hand washing It is commonly used in public toilets as a cost-effective alternative to paper towels It may either operate with the push of a button or automatically using a sensor == History == The earliest hand dryer was patented on June 13 1922 by R.B Hibbard D. J. Watrous and J.G Bassett as a `` Dryer Machine '' for the Airdry Corporation of Groton New York This machine was sold as a built in model or freestanding floor unit that consisted of an inverted blower ( much like a handheld blow dryer ) that was controlled by a floor pedal Known as `` Airdry The Electric Towel '' these units were used in restrooms barbershops and factories Airdry Corporation moved to Chicago and San Francisco in 1924 to centralize their distribution.The hand dryer was later popularized in 1948 by George Clemens who founded World Dryer and invented the Model A World Dryer ’ s flagship model In 1993 Mitsubishi Electric introduced a new type of hand dryer `` Jet Towel '' ( ja ジェットタオル ) that blows jets of air on both sides of the hand pushing the water off rather than evaporating it == Costs == Hand dryers have been popular with industries for their apparent economies According to manufacturers hand dryers can cut costs by as much as 99.5 % ( for example a company may spend $ 2340.00 per year on paper towels where as the hand dryer expenditure would be as low as $ 14.00 per year this will vary according to the cost of paper towels and electricity ) They require very little maintenance compared to paper towels which must be replaced An added benefit is the removal of the paper waste Hand dryers represent a larger initial investment so those responsible for facility management must do a careful cost analysis to determine whether they are cost effective in their building Costs are always relative to the kWh cost that the facility is charged by its provider In the UK this will typically be around 10-12p the only way to compare costs accurately is to work out the rated energy consumption and divide it by the number of drys the hand dryer is capable of performing back to back in 1 hour this will give the energy consumption per dry The world 's lowest energy hand dryer uses just 1 watt-hour per dry and is rated at 0.24 kW == Effect on environment == Due to the reduction in litter and waste in comparison with paper towels which can not be recycled hand dryers are claimed to be better for the environment By eliminating the need for paper towels hand dryer manufacturers estimate that over 5 billion paper towels from over 200,000 trees per year can be saved Another study shows that whereas the majority of the environmental impact of a hand dryer occurs during its use the environmental impact of paper"
/m/080hkjn,A handbag commonly known as a purse or pocketbook in North American English is a handled medium-to-large bag used to carry personal items == Purse handbag or pouch == The term `` purse '' originally referred to a small bag for holding coins In many English-speaking countries it is still used to refer to a small money bag A `` handbag '' is a larger accessory that holds objects beyond currency such as personal items American English typically uses the terms purse and handbag interchangeably The term handbag began appearing in the early 1900s Initially it was most often used to refer to men 's hand-luggage Women 's bags grew larger and more complex during this period and the term was attached to the accessory `` Pocketbook '' is another term for a woman 's handbag that was most commonly used on the East Coast of the United States in the mid-twentieth century == Modern origin == Early modern Europeans wore purses for one sole purpose to carry coins Purses were made of soft fabric or leather and were worn by men as often as ladies the Scottish sporran is a survival of this custom In the 17th century young girls were taught embroidery as a necessary skill for marriage this also helped them make very beautiful handbags.By the late 18th century fashions in Europe were moving towards a slender shape for these accessories inspired by the silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome Women wanted purses that would not be bulky or untidy in appearance so reticules were designed Reticules were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet carried with wrist straps First becoming popular in France they crossed over into Britain where they became known as `` indispensables '' Men however did not adopt the trend They used purses and pockets which became popular in men 's trousers.The modern purse clutch pouch or handbag came about in England during the Industrial Revolution in part due to the increase in travel by railway In 1841 the Doncaster industrialist and confectionery entrepreneur Samuel Parkinson ( of butterscotch fame ) ordered a set of traveling cases and trunks and insisted on a traveling case or bag for his wife 's particulars after noticing that her purse was too small and made from a material that would not withstand the journey He stipulated that he wanted various handbags for his wife varying in size for different occasions and asked that they be made from the same leather that was being used for his cases and trunks to distinguish them from the then-familiar carpetbag and other travelers cloth bags used by members of the popular classes H. J. Cave ( London ) obliged and produced the first modern set of luxury handbags as we would recognize them today including a clutch and a tote ( named as 'ladies traveling case ) These are now on display in the Museum of Bags and Purses in Amsterdam H. J. Cave did continue to sell and advertise the handbags but many critics said that women did not need
/m/0gxl3,A handgun is a short-barrelled gun typically a firearm that is designed to be usable with only one hand It is distinguished from a long gun ( i.e rifle shotgun or machine gun etc ) which needs to be held by both hands and also braced against the shoulder to be used properly The two most common types of handguns in modern times are revolvers and semi-automatic pistols although other types such as derringers and machine pistols also see infrequent usage Before commercial mass production handguns were often considered a badge of office comparable to a ceremonial sword As they had limited utility and were more expensive than the long guns of the era the few who could only afford to purchase them carried these handguns However in 1836 Samuel Colt patented the Colt Paterson the first practical mass-produced revolver which was capable of firing five shots in rapid succession and very quickly became a popular defensive weapon giving rise to the saying `` God created men but Colt made them equal '' Today in most of the world handguns are primarily used by police and military officers as sidearms However in the United States and some other countries around the world handguns are also widely available to civilians and commonly carried for self-defense == Definition == Although the exact definition of a handgun is sometimes disputed the general perception of what is a handgun does not vary far from a concealable close-range firearm that can be fired one-handed usually with an effective range of no greater than 100 metres ( 110 yd ) The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines a handgun as `` any firearm small enough to be held in one hand when fired '' while the American Webster 's Dictionary defines it as `` a firearm ( such as a revolver or pistol ) designed to be held and fired with one hand '' .Among the Anglophone countries neither the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) nor the Government of the United Kingdom who are in charge of American and British firearms licensing respectively offer any specific legal definitions of a handgun The ATF however do separately define `` handgun pistol '' and `` handgun resolver '' under its `` Terminology & Nomenclature '' section both with the `` pistol-type '' description of `` a weapon originally designed made and intended to fire a projectile ( bullet ) from one or more barrels when held in one hand '' .The Canadian Criminal Code defines a handgun as `` a firearm that is designed altered or intended to be aimed and fired by the action of one hand whether or not it has been redesigned or subsequently altered to be aimed and fired by the action of both hands '' .The Australian gun laws which are based on the National Firearms Agreement ( 1996 ) and interpreted and enforced independently by each state or territory considers a `` handgun '' a firearm that is reasonably capable of being carried or concealed about the person or is reasonably capable
/m/03qjg,The harmonica also known as a French harp or mouth organ is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres notably in blues American folk music classical music jazz country and rock The many types of harmonica include diatonic chromatic tremolo octave orchestral and bass versions A harmonica is played by using the mouth ( lips and tongue ) to direct air into or out of one ( or more ) holes along a mouthpiece Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed The most common is the diatonic Richter-tuned with ten air passages and twenty reeds often called the blues harp A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass stainless steel or bronze which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway When the free end is made to vibrate by the player 's air it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound Reeds are tuned to individual pitches Tuning may involve changing a reed ’ s length the weight near its free end or the stiffness near its fixed end Longer heavier and springier reeds produce deeper lower sounds shorter lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds If as on most modern harmonicas a reed is affixed above or below its slot rather than in the plane of the slot it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot i.e. as a closing reed This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a blow reed and a draw reed in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather ( valves wind-savers ) to block the nonplaying reed An important technique in performance is bending causing a drop in pitch by making embouchure adjustments Bending isolated reeds is possible as on chromatic and other harmonica models with wind-savers but also to both lower and raise ( overbend overblow overdraw ) the pitch produced by pairs of reeds in the same chamber as on a diatonic or other unvalved harmonica Such two-reed pitch changes actually involve sound production by the normally silent reed the opening reed ( for instance the blow reed while the player is drawing ) == Parts == The basic parts of the harmonica are the comb reed plates and cover plates === Comb === The comb is the main body of the instrument which when assembled with the reed plates forms air chambers for the reeds The term `` comb '' may originate from the similarity between this part of a harmonica and a hair comb Harmonica combs were traditionally made from wood but now are also made from plastic ( ABS ) or metal ( including titanium for high-end instruments ) Some modern and experimental comb designs are complex in the way that they direct the air Dispute exists among players about whether comb material affects the tone of a harmonica Those saying no argue that unlike
/m/03m5k,The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard the strings are plucked with the fingers Harps can be made and played in various ways standing or sitting and in orchestras or concerts Its most common form is triangular in shape and made of wood Some have multiple rows of strings and pedal attachments Ancient depictions of harps were recorded in Current-day Iraq ( Mesopotamia ) Iran ( Persia ) and Egypt and later in India and China By medieval times harps had spread across Europe Harps were found across the Americas where it was a popular folk tradition in some areas Distinct designs also emerged from the African continent Harps have symbolic political traditions and are often used in logos including in Ireland == History == Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia Africa and Europe dating back at least as early as 3000 BCE The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies and was disseminated to Europe 's colonies finding particular popularity in Latin America Although some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia descendants of early harps are still played in Myanmar and parts of Africa other variants defunct in Europe and Asia have been used by folk musicians in the modern era === Origin === ==== Middle East ==== The earliest harps and lyres were found in Sumer 3500 BCE and several harps were excavated from burial pits and royal tombs in Ur The oldest depictions of harps without a forepillar can be seen adjacent to the Near East in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs in the Nile Valley which date from as early as 3000 BCE These murals show an instrument that closely resembles the hunter 's bow without the pillar that we find in modern harps The Chang flourished in Persia in many forms from its introduction about 4000 BCE until the 17th century Around 1900 BCE arched harps in the Iraq-Iran region were replaced by angular harps with vertical or horizontal sound boxes.By the start of the Common Era `` robust vertical angular harps '' which had become predominant in the Hellenistic world were cherished in the Sasanian court In the last century of the Sasanian period angular harps were redesigned to make them as light as possible ( `` light vertical angular harps '' ) while they became more elegant they lost their structural rigidity At the height of the Persian tradition of illustrated book production ( 1300–1600 CE ) such light harps were still frequently depicted although their use as musical instruments was reaching its end ==== South Asia ==== Mesolithic era paintings from Bhimbetka show harp playing An arched harp made of wooden brackets and metal strings is depicted on an Indus seal The works of the Tamil Sangam literature describe the harp and its variants as early as 200 BCE Variants
/m/03q5t,A harpsichord ( Italian clavicembalo French clavecin German Cembalo Spanish clavecín Portuguese cravo Dutch klavecimbel Polish klawesyn ) is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard This activates a row of levers that turn a trigger mechanism that plucks one or more strings with a small plectrum made from quill or plastic The strings are under tension on a soundboard which is mounted in a wooden case the soundboard amplifies the vibrations from the strings so that the listeners can hear it Like a pipe organ a harpsichord may have more than one keyboard manual and even a pedal board Harpsichords may also have stop buttons which add or remove additional octaves Some harpsichords may have a buff stop which brings a strip of buff leather or other material in contact with the strings muting their sound to simulate the sound of a plucked lute.The term denotes the whole family of similar plucked-keyboard instruments including the smaller virginals muselar and spinet The harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque music both as an accompaniment instrument and as a soloing instrument During the Baroque era the harpsichord was a standard part of the continuo group The basso continuo part acted as the foundation for many musical pieces in this era During the late 18th century with the development of the fortepiano ( and then the increasing use of the piano in the 19th century ) the harpsichord gradually disappeared from the musical scene ( except in opera where it continued to be used to accompany recitative ) In the 20th century it made a resurgence being used in historically informed performances of older music in new compositions and in rare cases in certain styles of popular music ( e.g. Baroque pop ) == History == The harpsichord was most likely invented in the late Middle Ages By the 16th century harpsichord makers in Italy were making lightweight instruments with low tension brass stringing A different approach was taken in the Southern Netherlands starting in the late 16th century notably by the Ruckers family Their harpsichords used a heavier construction and produced a more powerful and distinctive tone with higher tension steel treble stringing These included the first harpsichords with two keyboards used for transposition.The Flemish instruments served as the model for 18th-century harpsichord construction in other nations In France the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings making a more musically flexible instrument ( so-called 'expressive doubles ) Instruments from the peak of the French tradition by makers such as the Blanchet family and Pascal Taskin are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments In England the Kirkman and Shudi firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority German builders such as Hieronymus Albrecht Hass extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding sixteen-foot and two-foot choirs these instruments have recently served as models for modern builders.Around the year 1700 the first fortepiano was built by Bartolomeo Cristofori The early fortepiano uses

/m/09ct_,A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically to hover and to fly forward backward and laterally These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of STOL ( Short TakeOff and Landing ) or STOVL ( Short TakeOff and Vertical Landing ) aircraft can not perform without a runway In 1942 the Sikorsky R-4 became the first helicopter to reach full-scale production.Although most earlier designs used more than one main rotor the configuration of a single main rotor accompanied by a vertical anti-torque tail rotor ( i.e unicopter not to be confused with the single-blade monocopter ) has become the most common helicopter configuration However twin-main rotor helicopters ( bicopters ) in either tandem or transverse rotors configurations are sometimes in use due to their greater payload capacity than the monorotor design and coaxial-rotor tiltrotor and compound helicopters are also all flying today Quadrotor helicopters ( quadcopters ) were pioneered as early as 1907 in France and along with other types of multicopters have been developed mainly for specialized applications such as drones == Etymology == The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word hélicoptère coined by Gustave Ponton d'Amécourt in 1861 which originates from the Greek helix ( ἕλιξ ) `` helix spiral whirl convolution '' and pteron ( πτερόν ) `` wing '' For various reasons the word is often erroneously from an etymological point of view analysed by English speakers into heli- and copter leading to words like helipad and quadcopter English language nicknames for `` helicopter '' include `` chopper '' `` copter '' `` heli '' and `` whirlybird '' In the United States military the common slang is `` helo '' pronounced with a long `` e '' == Design characteristics == A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by one or more horizontally-spinning rotors By contrast the autogyro ( or gyroplane ) and gyrodyne have a free-spinning rotor for all or part of the flight envelope relying on a separate thrust system to propel the craft forwards so that the airflow sets the rotor spinning to provide lift The compound helicopter also has a separate thrust system but continues to supply power to the rotor throughout normal flight === Rotor system === The rotor system or more simply rotor is the rotating part of a helicopter that generates lift A rotor system may be mounted horizontally as main rotors are providing lift vertically or it may be mounted vertically such as a tail rotor to provide horizontal thrust to counteract torque from the main rotors The rotor consists of a mast hub and rotor blades The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upwards from the transmission At the top of the mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub Main rotor systems are classified according to how the rotor blades

/m/0fz0h,A honeycomb is a mass of hexagonal prismatic wax cells built by honey bees in their nests to contain their larvae and stores of honey and pollen Beekeepers may remove the entire honeycomb to harvest honey Honey bees consume about 8.4 lb ( 3.8 kg ) of honey to secrete 1 lb ( 450 g ) of wax and so beekeepers may return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey to improve honey outputs The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine more specifically a honey extractor If the honeycomb is too worn out the wax can be reused in a number of ways including making sheets of comb foundation with hexagonal pattern Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells Fresh new comb is sometimes sold and used intact as comb honey especially if the honey is being spread on bread rather than used in cooking or as a sweetener Broodcomb becomes dark over time due to empty cocoons and shed larval skins embedded in the cells alongside being walked over constantly by other bees resulting in what is referred to as a 'travel stain by beekeepers when seen on frames of comb honey Honeycomb in the `` supers '' that are not used for brood ( e.g by the placement of a queen excluder ) stays light-colored Numerous wasps especially Polistinae and Vespinae construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax in some species ( such as Brachygastra mellifica ) honey is stored in the nest thus technically forming a paper honeycomb However the term `` honeycomb '' is not often used for such structures == Geometry == The axes of honeycomb cells are always nearly horizontal with the open end higher than the back end The open end of a cell is typically referred to as the top of the cell while the opposite end is called the bottom The cells slope slightly upwards between 9 and 14° towards the open ends.Two possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons rather than any other shape First the hexagonal tiling creates a partition with equal-sized cells while minimizing the total perimeter of the cells Known in geometry as the honeycomb conjecture this was given by Jan Brożek and mathematically proven much later by Thomas Hales Thus a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given volume A second reason given by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson is that the shape simply results from the process of individual bees putting cells together somewhat analogous to the boundary shapes created in a field of soap bubbles In support of this he notes that queen cells which are constructed singly are irregular and lumpy with no apparent attempt at efficiency.The closed ends of the honeycomb cells are also an example of geometric efficiency

/m/031n1,Humans eat various food substances for enjoyment and nutritional support It is usually of plant animal or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins or minerals Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems Historically humans secured food through two main methods hunting and gathering and agriculture As agricultural technologies increased humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts including a wide array of ingredients herbs spices techniques and dishes As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices Today the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change accountable for as much as 37 % of total greenhouse gas emissions Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including sustainability biological diversity economics population growth water supply and access to food The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) recognizing the `` right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food '' as well as the `` fundamental right to be free from hunger '' Because of these fundamental rights food security is often a priority international policy activity for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 `` Zero hunger '' is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030 Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection World Resources Institute World Food Programme Food and Agriculture Organization and International Food Information Council and are often subject to national regulation by institutions like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States == Food sources == Humans are omnivores finding sustenance in vegetables fruits cooked meat milk eggs mushrooms and seaweed Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop Corn ( maize ) wheat and rice account for 87 % of all grain production worldwide Just over half of the worlds crops are used to feed humans ( 55 percent ) with 36 percent grown as animal feed and 9 percent for biofuels Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread wine cheese and yogurt Humans only eat about 200 out of the worlds 400 000 plant species despite at least half of
/m/03q69,Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals The human body apart from areas of glabrous skin is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth hair types and hair care but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein notably alpha-keratin Attitudes towards different forms of hair such as hairstyles and hair removal vary widely across different cultures and historical periods but it is often used to indicate a person 's personal beliefs or social position such as their age sex or religion == Overview == The word `` hair '' usually refers to two distinct structures the part beneath the skin called the hair follicle or when pulled from the skin the bulb or root This organ is located in the dermis and maintains stem cells which not only re-grow the hair after it falls out but also are recruited to regrow skin after a wound the hair shaft which is the hard filamentous part that extends above the skin surface A cross section of the hair shaft may be divided roughly into three zones.Hair fibers have a structure consisting of several layers starting from the outside the cuticle which consists of several layers of flat thin cells laid out overlapping one another as roof shingles the cortex which contains the keratin bundles in cell structures that remain roughly rod-like the medulla a disorganized and open area at the fiber 's center == Description == Each strand of hair is made up of the medulla cortex and cuticle The innermost region the medulla is an open and unstructured region which is not always present The highly structural and organized cortex or second of three layers of the hair is the primary source of mechanical strength and water uptake The cortex contains melanin which colors the fiber based on the number distribution and types of melanin granules The shape of the follicle determines the shape of the cortex and the shape of the fiber is related to how straight or curly the hair is People with straight hair have round hair fibers Oval and other shaped fibers are generally more wavy or curly The cuticle is the outer covering Its complex structure slides as the hair swells and is covered with a single molecular layer of lipid that makes the hair repel water The diameter of human hair varies from 0.017 to 0.18 millimeters ( 0.00067 to 0.00709 in ) There are roughly two million small tubular glands and sweat glands that produce watery fluids that cool the body by evaporation The glands at the opening of the hair produce a fatty secretion that lubricates the hair.Hair growth begins inside the hair follicle The only `` living '' portion of the hair is found in the follicle The hair that is visible is the hair shaft which exhibits no biochemical activity and is considered `` dead '' The base of a hair
/m/0k65p,A hand is a prehensile multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans chimpanzees monkeys and lemurs A few other vertebrates such as the koala ( which has two opposable thumbs on each `` hand '' and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints ) are often described as having `` hands '' instead of paws on their front limbs The raccoon is usually described as having `` hands '' though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally—for example in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits four fingers plus one thumb these are often referred to collectively as five fingers however whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers It has 27 bones not including the sesamoid bone the number of which varies among people 14 of which are the phalanges ( proximal intermediate and distal ) of the fingers and thumb The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body and are the richest source of tactile feedback They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body thus the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands Like other paired organs ( eyes feet legs ) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil reflects individual brain functioning Among humans the hands play an important function in body language and sign language Likewise the ten digits of two hands and the twelve phalanges of four fingers ( touchable by the thumb ) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques == Structure == Many mammals and other animals have grasping appendages similar in form to a hand such as paws claws and talons but these are not scientifically considered to be grasping hands The scientific use of the term hand in this sense to distinguish the terminations of the front paws from the hind ones is an example of anthropomorphism The only true grasping hands appear in the mammalian order of primates Hands must also have opposable thumbs as described later in the text The hand is located at the distal end of each arm Apes and monkeys are sometimes described as having four hands because the toes are long and the hallux is opposable and looks more like a thumb thus enabling the feet to be used as hands The word `` hand '' is sometimes used by evolutionary anatomists to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb such as when researching the homology between the three digits of the bird hand and the dinosaur hand.An adult human male 's hand weighs about a
/m/04hgtk,In human anatomy the head is at the top of the human body It supports the face and is maintained by the skull which itself encloses the brain == Structure == The human head consists of a fleshy outer portion which surrounds the bony skull The brain is enclosed within the skull There are 22 bones in the human head The head rests on the neck and the seven cervical vertebrae support it The human head typically weighs between 2.3 and 5 kilograms ( 5.1 and 11.0 lb ) Over 98 % of humans fit into this range There have been odd incidences where human beings have abnormally small or large heads The Zika virus was responsible for underdeveloped heads in the early 2000s The face is the anterior part of the head containing the eyes nose and mouth On either side of the mouth the cheeks provide a fleshy border to the oral cavity The ears sit to either side of the head === Blood supply === The head receives blood supply through the internal and external carotid arteries These supply the area outside of the skull ( external carotid artery ) and inside of the skull ( internal carotid artery ) The area inside the skull also receives blood supply from the vertebral arteries which travel up through the cervical vertebrae === Nerve supply === The twelve pairs of cranial nerves provide the majority of nervous control to the head The sensation to the face is provided by the branches of the trigeminal nerve the fifth cranial nerve Sensation to other portions of the head is provided by the cervical nerves Modern texts are in agreement about which areas of the skin are served by which nerves but there are minor variations in some of the details The borders designated by diagrams in the 1918 edition of Gray 's Anatomy are similar but not identical to those generally accepted today The cutaneous innervation of the head is as follows Ophthalmic nerve ( green ) Maxillary nerve ( pink ) Mandibular nerve ( yellow ) Cervical plexus ( purple ) Dorsal rami of cervical nerves ( blue ) and others are in picture which show following in upper column == Function == The head contains sensory organs two eyes two ears a nose and tongue inside of the mouth It also houses the brain Together these organs function as a processing center for the body by relaying sensory information to the brain Humans can process information faster by having this central nerve cluster == Society and culture == For humans the front of the head ( the face ) is the main distinguishing feature between different people due to its easily discernible features such as eye and hair colors shapes of the sensory organs and the wrinkles Humans easily differentiate between faces because of the brain 's predisposition toward facial recognition When observing a relatively unfamiliar species all faces seem nearly identical Human infants are biologically programmed to recognize subtle differences in anthropomorphic facial features People who have greater than average
/m/035r7c,The human leg in the general word sense is the entire lower limb of the human body including the foot thigh or sometimes even the hip or gluteal region However the definition in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle also known as the crus or especially in non-technical use the shank Legs are used for standing and all forms of locomotion including recreational such as dancing and constitute a significant portion of a person 's mass Female legs generally have greater hip anteversion and tibiofemoral angles but shorter femur and tibial lengths than those in males == Structure == In human anatomy the lower leg is the part of the lower limb that lies between the knee and the ankle Anatomists restrict the term leg to this use rather than to the entire lower limb The thigh is between the hip and knee and makes up the rest of the lower limb The term lower limb or lower extremity is commonly used to describe all of the leg The leg from the knee to the ankle is called the crus The calf is the back portion and the tibia or shinbone together with the smaller fibula make up the front of the lower leg Evolution has provided the human body with two distinct features the specialization of the upper limb for visually guided manipulation and the lower limb 's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait While the capacity to walk upright is not unique to humans other primates can only achieve this for short periods and at a great expenditure of energy.The human adaption to bipedalism has also affected the location of the body 's center of gravity the reorganization of internal organs and the form and biomechanism of the trunk In humans the double S-shaped vertebral column acts as a great shock-absorber which shifts the weight from the trunk over the load-bearing surface of the feet The human legs are exceptionally long and powerful as a result of their exclusive specialization for support and locomotion—in orangutans the leg length is 111 % of the trunk in chimpanzees 128 % and in humans 171 % Many of the leg 's muscles are also adapted to bipedalism most substantially the gluteal muscles the extensors of the knee joint and the calf muscles === Skeleton === The major bones of the leg are the femur ( thigh bone ) tibia ( shin bone ) and adjacent fibula and these are all long bones The patella ( kneecap ) is the sesamoid bone in front of the knee Most of the leg skeleton has bony prominences and margins that can be palpated and some serve as anatomical landmarks that define the extent of the leg These landmarks are the anterior superior iliac spine the greater trochanter the superior margin of the medial condyle of tibia and the medial malleolus Notable exceptions to palpation are the hip joint and the neck and body or shaft of the femur Usually the
/m/0283dt1,In human anatomy the mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and produces saliva The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane epithelium lining the inside of the mouth In addition to its primary role as the beginning of the digestive system the mouth also plays a significant role in communication While primary aspects of the voice are produced in the throat the tongue lips and jaw are also needed to produce the range of sounds included in speech The mouth consists of two regions the vestibule and the oral cavity proper The mouth normally moist is lined with a mucous membrane and contains the teeth The lips mark the transition from mucous membrane to skin which covers most of the body == Structure == === Oral cavity === The mouth consists of two regions the vestibule and the oral cavity proper The vestibule is the area between the teeth lips and cheeks The oral cavity is bounded at the sides and in front by the alveolar process ( containing the teeth ) and at the back by the isthmus of the fauces Its roof is formed by the hard palate at the front and the soft palate at the back The uvula projects downwards from the middle of the soft palate at its back The floor is formed by the mylohyoid muscles and is occupied mainly by the tongue A mucous membrane – the oral mucosa lines the sides and under surface of the tongue to the gums and lines the inner aspect of the jaw ( mandible ) It receives secretions from the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands === Lips === The lips come together to close the opening of the mouth forming a line between the upper and lower lip In facial expression this mouth line is iconically shaped like an up-open parabola in a smile and like a down-open parabola in a frown A down-turned mouth means a mouth line forming a down-turned parabola and when permanent can be normal Also a down-turned mouth can be part of the presentation of Prader–Willi syndrome === Nerve supply === The teeth and the periodontium ( the tissues that support the teeth ) are innervated by the maxillary and mandibular nerves – divisions of the trigeminal nerve Maxillary ( upper ) teeth and their associated periodontal ligament are innervated by the superior alveolar nerves branches of the maxillary division termed the posterior superior alveolar nerve anterior superior alveolar nerve and the variably present middle superior alveolar nerve These nerves form the superior dental plexus above the maxillary teeth The mandibular ( lower ) teeth and their associated periodontal ligament are innervated by the inferior alveolar nerve a branch of the mandibular division This nerve runs inside the mandible within the inferior alveolar canal below the mandibular teeth giving off branches to all the lower teeth ( inferior dental plexus ) The oral mucosa of the gingiva ( gums ) on the facial ( labial ) aspect of the maxillary incisors canines and premolar teeth is innervated by
/m/0k0pj,The human nose is the most protruding part of the face It bears the nostrils and is the first organ of the respiratory system It is also the principal organ in the olfactory system The shape of the nose is determined by the nasal bones and the nasal cartilages including the nasal septum which separates the nostrils and divides the nasal cavity into two On average the nose of a male is larger than that of a female The nose has an important function in breathing The nasal mucosa lining the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it Nasal conchae shell-like bones in the walls of the cavities play a major part in this process Filtering of the air by nasal hair in the nostrils prevents large particles from entering the lungs Sneezing is a reflex to expel unwanted particles from the nose that irritate the mucosal lining Sneezing can transmit infections because aerosols are created in which the droplets can harbour pathogens Another major function of the nose is olfaction the sense of smell The area of olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity contains specialised olfactory cells responsible for this function The nose is also involved in the function of speech Nasal vowels and nasal consonants are produced in the process of nasalisation The hollow cavities of the paranasal sinuses act as sound chambers that modify and amplify speech and other vocal sounds There are several plastic surgery procedures that can be done on the nose known as rhinoplasties available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose Defects may be congenital or result from nasal disorders or from trauma These procedures are a type of reconstructive surgery Elective procedures to change a nose shape are a type of cosmetic surgery == Structure == Several bones and cartilages make up the bony-cartilaginous framework of the nose and the internal structure The nose is also made up of types of soft tissue such as skin epithelia mucous membrane muscles nerves and blood vessels In the skin there are sebaceous glands and in the mucous membrane there are nasal glands The bones and cartilages provide strong protection for the internal structures of the nose There are several muscles that are involved in movements of the nose The arrangement of the cartilages allows flexibility through muscle control to enable airflow to be modified === Bones === The bony structure of the nose is provided by the maxilla frontal bone and a number of smaller bones.The topmost bony part of the nose is formed by the nasal part of the frontal bone which lies between the brow ridges and ends in a serrated nasal notch A left and a right nasal bone join with the nasal part of the frontal bone at either side and these at the side with the small lacrimal bones and the frontal process of each maxilla The internal roof of the nasal cavity is composed of the horizontal perforated cribriform plate of

/m/0cxn2,Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener either sugar or an alternative and a spice such as cocoa or vanilla or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together Food coloring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming The result is a smooth semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures ( below 2 °C or 35 °F ) It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases The meaning of the name `` ice cream '' varies from one country to another In some countries such as the United States `` ice cream '' applies only to a specific variety and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients notably the amount of cream Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled `` frozen dairy dessert '' instead In other countries such as Italy and Argentina one word is used for all variants Analogues made from dairy alternatives such as goat 's or sheep 's milk or milk substitutes ( e.g. soy cashew coconut almond milk or tofu ) are available for those who are lactose intolerant allergic to dairy protein or vegan Ice cream may be served in dishes for eating with a spoon or licked from edible wafer cones Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as apple pie or as an ingredient in ice cream floats sundaes milkshakes ice cream cakes and baked items such as Baked Alaska == History == === Early frozen desserts === The origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history Some sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BC.A Roman cookbook dating back to the 1st-century includes recipes for sweet desserts that are sprinkled with snow.There are Persian records from the 2nd-century for sweetened drinks chilled with ice.There are Tang dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour camphor and water buffalo milk.Kakigori was a Japanese dessert using ice and flavored syrup The origins of kakigōri date back the Heian period in Japanese history when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to Japanese aristocracy during the summer Kakigōri 's origin is referred to in The Pillow Book a book of observations written by Sei Shōnagon who served the Imperial Court during the Heian period.The earliest known written process to artificially make ice is known not from culinary texts but the 13th-century writings of Arab historian Ibn Abu Usaybia in his book Kitab Uyun al-anba fi tabaqat-al-atibba ( Book of Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians ) concerning medicine in which
/m/03wym,An indoor rower or rowing machine is a machine used to simulate the action of watercraft rowing for the purpose of exercise or training for rowing Modern indoor rowers are often known as ergometers ( colloquially erg or ergo ) because they measure work performed by the rower ( which can be measured in ergs ) Indoor rowing has become established as a sport drawing a competitive environment from around the world The term `` indoor rower '' also refers to a participant in this sport == History == Chabrias an Athenian admiral of the 4th century BC introduced the first rowing machines as supplemental military training devices `` To train inexperienced oarsmen Chabrias built wooden rowing frames onshore where beginners could learn technique and timing before they went onboard ship `` Early rowing machines are known to have existed from the mid-1800s a US patent being issued to W.B Curtis in 1872 for a particular hydraulic-based damper design Machines using linear pneumatic resistance were common around 1900—one of the most popular was the Narragansett hydraulic rower manufactured in Rhode Island from around 1900–1960 In the 1970s the Gjessing-Nilson ergometer from Norway used a friction brake mechanism with industrial strapping applied over the broad rim of the flywheel Weights hanging from the strap ensured that an adjustable and predictable friction could be calculated.The first air resistance ergometers were introduced around 1980 by Repco In 1981 Peter and Richard Dreissigacker and Jonathan Williams filed for U.S. patent protection as joint inventors of a `` Stationary Rowing Unit '' The first commercial embodiment of the Concept2 `` rowing ergometer '' was the Model A a fixed-frame sliding-seat design using a bicycle wheel with fins attached for air resistance The Model B introduced in 1986 introduced a solid cast flywheel and the first digital performance monitor which proved revolutionary This machine 's capability of accurate calibration combined with easy transportability spawned the sport of competitive indoor rowing and revolutionised training and selection procedures for watercraft rowing Later models were the C ( 1993 ) and D ( 2003 ) .In 1995 Casper Rekers a Dutch engineer was granted a U.S. patent for a ( US 5382210A ) `` Dynamically Balanced Rowing Simulator '' This device differed from the prior art in that the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a carriage the carriage being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame The seat is also free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame == Equipment == === Motion type === Modern indoor rowers have their resistance provided by a flywheel Indoor rowers that utilise flywheel resistance can be categorised into two motion types In both types the rowing movement of the user causes the footrests and the seat to move further and closer apart in co-ordination with the user 's stroke The difference between the two types is in the movement or absence of movement of the footrests relative to ground The first type is characterised by the Dreissigacker/Williams device
/m/061hd_,An infant bed ( commonly called a cot in British English and in American English a crib or far less commonly stock ) is a small bed especially for infants and very young children Infant beds are a historically recent development intended to contain a child capable of standing The cage-like design of infant beds restricts the child to the bed Between one and two years of age children are able to climb out and are moved to a toddler bed to prevent an injurious fall while escaping the bed Infant beds are more common in Western countries employed by the majority of parents as an alternative to sharing a bed ( co-sleeping ) == History == The name `` crib '' was used to describe a slatted high-sided child 's bed It derives from the Old English word `` cribb '' which means `` manger '' ( food trough referring to the shape of a bassinette ) or stall ( implying corralling the child ) It was n't until the 19th century that infant beds developed from bassinettes acquiring a role of keeping the child in their bed The development of a distinction between infant beds and bassinettes was natural because it was `` considered vital that the child 's bed be raised off the ground '' This was due to a perception of noxious fumes below knee level and explosive vapours near the ceiling with good air in between Once children 's beds were raised off the ground the role of the sides changed from a convenience to a safety feature It was recognised that once children learn to stand they may be able to get out of a bed with low sides According to an expert of the time infant beds were used once the child was 12 months old Often one side was hinged to open the enclosure a function fulfilled in modern infant beds with a dropside With the hinge side lowered the bed could be moved on casters and they could be moved right up to the carer 's bed when needed.Iron beds were developed in 17th century Italy to address concerns about bed bug infestation and moths This new application was quickly extended to children 's beds a rockable iron bassinette ( with spear-like corner posts ) has been dated to 1620–1640 Proponents promoted the supposed health benefits of iron beds Infant beds constructed from metal became popular during the later half of the 19th century Infant beds ( and bassinettes ) constructed from iron with mesh or chain sides were common Childcare experts gave iron beds their approval because it was hygienic material ( compared with wood ) and could not `` harbour vermin '' of which bed bug infestation lice and moths were cited concerns Commonly painted with a white vitreous enamel later manufacturers working with wood continued to paint in the now traditional white unfortunately this was often lead paint and children were notorious for chewing and sucking the sweet surface Since 1938 babies in Finland have slept in cardboard boxes with

/m/03xxp,Invertebrates are a paraphyletic group of animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column ( commonly known as a backbone or spine ) derived from the notochord This is a grouping including all animals apart from the chordate subphylum Vertebrata Familiar examples of invertebrates include arthropods mollusks annelids echinoderms and cnidarians The majority of animal species are invertebrates one estimate puts the figure at 97 % Many invertebrate taxa have a greater number and variety of species than the entire subphylum of Vertebrata Invertebrates vary widely in size from 50 μm ( 0.002 in ) rotifers to the 9–10 m ( 30–33 ft ) colossal squid.Some so-called invertebrates such as the Tunicata and Cephalochordata are more closely related to vertebrates than to other invertebrates This makes the invertebrates paraphyletic so the term has little meaning in taxonomy == Etymology == The word `` invertebrate '' comes from the Latin word vertebra which means a joint in general and sometimes specifically a joint from the spinal column of a vertebrate The jointed aspect of vertebra is derived from the concept of turning expressed in the root verto or vorto to turn The prefix in- means `` not '' or `` without '' == Taxonomic significance == The term invertebrates is not always precise among non-biologists since it does not accurately describe a taxon in the same way that Arthropoda Vertebrata or Manidae do Each of these terms describes a valid taxon phylum subphylum or family `` Invertebrata '' is a term of convenience not a taxon it has very little circumscriptional significance except within the Chordata The Vertebrata as a subphylum comprises such a small proportion of the Metazoa that to speak of the kingdom Animalia in terms of `` Vertebrata '' and `` Invertebrata '' has limited practicality In the more formal taxonomy of Animalia other attributes that logically should precede the presence or absence of the vertebral column in constructing a cladogram for example the presence of a notochord That would at least circumscribe the Chordata However even the notochord would be a less fundamental criterion than aspects of embryological development and symmetry or perhaps bauplan.Despite this the concept of invertebrates as a taxon of animals has persisted for over a century among the laity and within the zoological community and in its literature it remains in use as a term of convenience for animals that are not members of the Vertebrata The following text reflects earlier scientific understanding of the term and of those animals which have constituted it According to this understanding invertebrates do not possess a skeleton of bone either internal or external They include hugely varied body plans Many have fluid-filled hydrostatic skeletons like jellyfish or worms Others have hard exoskeletons outer shells like those of insects and crustaceans The most familiar invertebrates include the Protozoa Porifera Coelenterata Platyhelminthes Nematoda Annelida Echinodermata Mollusca and Arthropoda Arthropoda include insects crustaceans and arachnids == Number of extant species == By far the largest number of described invertebrate species are insects The following table lists the number of described

/m/01jfsr,A lantern is an often portable source of lighting typically featuring a protective enclosure for the light source – historically usually a candle or a wick in oil and often a battery-powered light in modern times – to make it easier to carry and hang up and make it more reliable outdoors or in drafty interiors Lanterns may also be used for signaling as torches or as general light-sources outdoors == Use == The lantern enclosure was primarily used to prevent a burning candle or wick being extinguished from wind rain or other causes Some antique lanterns have only a metal grid indicating their function was to protect the candle or wick during transportation and avoid the excess heat from the top to avoid unexpected fires Another important function was to reduce the risk of fire should a spark leap from the flame or the light be dropped This was especially important below deck on ships a fire on a wooden ship was a major catastrophe Use of unguarded lights was taken so seriously that obligatory use of lanterns rather than unprotected flames below decks was written into one of the few known remaining examples of a pirate code on pain of severe punishment.Lanterns may also be used for signaling In naval operations ships used lights to communicate at least as far back as the Middle Ages the use of a lantern that blinks code to transmit a message dates to the mid-1800s In railroad operations lanterns have multiple uses Permanent lanterns on poles are used to signal trains about the operational status of the track ahead sometimes with color gels in front of the light to signify stop etc Historically a flagman at a level crossing used a lantern to stop cars and other vehicular traffic before a train arrived Lanterns also provided a means to signal from train-to-train or from station-to-train.A `` dark lantern '' was a candle lantern with a sliding shutter so that a space could be conveniently made dark without extinguishing the candle For example in the Sherlock Holmes story `` The Red-Headed League '' the detective and police make their way down to a bank vault by lantern light but then put a 'screen over that dark lantern in order to wait in the dark for thieves to finish tunneling This type of lantern could also preserve the light source for sudden use when needed Lanterns may be used in religious observances In the Eastern Orthodox Church lanterns are used in religious processions and liturgical entrances usually coming before the processional cross Lanterns are also used to transport the Holy Fire from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Great Saturday during Holy Week Lanterns are used in many Asian festivals During the Ghost Festival lotus shaped lanterns are set afloat in rivers and seas to symbolically guide the lost souls of forgotten ancestors to the afterlife During the Lantern Festival the displaying of many lanterns is still a common sight on the 15th day of the first lunar month throughout China During other Chinese festivities

Newton.As a component of an electrical wiring or home wiring system the installation of light switches is regulated by some authority concerned with safety and standards In different countries the standard dimensions of the wall mounting hardware ( boxes plates etc ) may differ Since the face-plates used must cover this hardware these standards determine the minimum sizes of all wall mounted equipment Hence the shape and size of the boxes and face-plates as well as what is integrated varies
/m/04h7h,A lighthouse is a tower building or other type of physical structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a beacon for navigational aid for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines hazardous shoals reefs rocks and safe entries to harbors they also assist in aerial navigation Once widely used the number of operational lighthouses has declined due to the expense of maintenance and has become uneconomical since the advent of much cheaper more sophisticated and effective electronic navigational systems == History == === Ancient lighthouses === Before the development of clearly defined ports mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops Since elevating the fire would improve the visibility placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led to the development of the lighthouse In antiquity the lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning signal for reefs and promontories unlike many modern lighthouses The most famous lighthouse structure from antiquity was the Pharos of Alexandria Egypt which collapsed following a series of earthquakes between 956 CE and 1323 CE The intact Tower of Hercules at A Coruña Spain gives insight into ancient lighthouse construction other evidence about lighthouses exists in depictions on coins and mosaics of which many represent the lighthouse at Ostia Coins from Alexandria Ostia and Laodicea in Syria also exist === Modern construction === The modern era of lighthouses began at the turn of the 18th century as the number of lighthouses being constructed increased significantly due to much higher levels of transatlantic commerce Advances in structural engineering and new and efficient lighting equipment allowed for the creation of larger and more powerful lighthouses including ones exposed to the sea The function of lighthouses was gradually changed from indicating ports to the providing of a visible warning against shipping hazards such as rocks or reefs The Eddystone Rocks were a major shipwreck hazard for mariners sailing through the English Channel The first lighthouse built there was an octagonal wooden structure anchored by 12 iron stanchions secured in the rock and was built by Henry Winstanley from 1696 to 1698 His lighthouse was the first tower in the world to have been fully exposed to the open sea.The civil engineer John Smeaton rebuilt the lighthouse from 1756 to 1759 his tower marked a major step forward in the design of lighthouses and remained in use until 1877 He modeled the shape of his lighthouse on that of an oak tree using granite blocks He rediscovered and used `` hydraulic lime '' a form of concrete that will set under water used by the Romans and developed a technique of securing the granite blocks together using dovetail joints and marble dowels The dovetailing feature served to improve the structural stability although Smeaton also had to taper the thickness of the tower towards the top for which he curved the tower inwards on a gentle gradient This profile had the added advantage of allowing some of the energy of the
/m/01lcw4,A limousine ( or ) or limo ( ) for short is a large chauffeur-driven luxury vehicle with a partition between the driver compartment and the passenger compartment.A very long wheelbase luxury sedan ( with more than four doors ) driven by a professional driver is called a stretch limousine.In some countries such as the United States Germany Canada and Australia a limousine service may be any pre-booked hire car with driver usually but not always a luxury car In particular airport shuttle services are often called limousine services though they often use minibuses == Etymology == The word limousine is derived from the name of the French region Limousin However how the name of the region transferred to the car is uncertain One possibility involves a particular type of carriage hood or roof that physically resembled the raised hood of the cloak worn by the shepherds there.An alternate etymology speculates that some early chauffeurs wore a Limousin-style cloak in the open driver 's compartment for protection from the weather The name was then extended to this particular type of car with a permanent top projecting over the chauffeur This former type of automobile had an enclosed passenger compartment seating three to five persons with only a roof projecting forward over the open driver 's area in the front == History == Rich owners of expensive carriages and their passengers were accustomed to their own private compartments leaving their coachman or driver outside in all weathers When automobiles arrived the same people required a similar arrangement for their chauffeurs As such the 1916 definition of limousine by the US Society of Automobile Engineers is `` a closed car seating three to five inside with driver 's seat outside '' .In Great Britain the limousine de-ville was a version of the limousine town car where the driver 's compartment was outside and had no weather protection 103 The limousine-landaulet variant ( also sold in the United States ) had a removable or folding roof section over the rear passenger seat 100 In the United States sub-categories of limousines in 1916 were the berline defined as `` a limousine having the driver 's seat entirely enclosed '' and the brougham defined as `` a limousine with no roof over the driver 's seat '' == Characteristics == The limousine body style usually has a partition separating the driver from the rear passenger compartment 96 This partition includes a usually openable glass section so passengers may see the road Communication with the driver is possible either by opening the window in the partition or by using an intercom system Limousines are often long-wheelbase vehicles in order to provide extra legroom in the passenger compartment There will usually be occasional seats ( in the U.S. called jump seats ) at the front of the compartment ( either forward-facing rear-facing or able to face either direction ) Many nations have official state cars designed to transport government officials The top leaders have dedicated and specially equipped limousines The United States Presidential State Car is the official car

/m/07v9_z,A measuring cup is a kitchen utensil used primarily to measure the volume of liquid or bulk solid cooking ingredients such as flour and sugar especially for volumes from about 50 mL ( 2 fl oz ) upwards Measuring cups are also used to measure washing powder liquid detergents and bleach for clothes washing The cup will usually have a scale marked in cups and fractions of a cup and often with fluid measure and weight of a selection of dry foodstuffs Measuring cups may be made of plastic glass or metal Transparent ( or translucent ) cups can be read from an external scale metal ones only from a dipstick or scale marked on the inside == Capacity and scale == Measuring cups usually have capacities from 250 mL ( approx 1 cup ) to 1000 mL ( approx 4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart ) though larger sizes are also available for commercial use They usually have scale markings at different heights the substance being measured is added to the cup until it reaches the wanted level Dry measure cups without a scale are sometimes used in sets typically of 1/4 1/3 1/2 and 1 cup The units may be milliliters or fractions of a liter or the cup ( unit with varying definitions ) with its fractions ( typically 1/4 1/3 1/2 2/3 and 3/4 ) pints and often fluid ounces Dry measure cups are distinguished from liquid measure cups in that they are meant to be filled to the top so that excess may be scraped off and shallow for easy cleaning Liquid measure cups tend to be microwave safe for heating and clear to more easily judge the meniscus.Sometimes multiples of teaspoons and tablespoons are included There may also be scales for the approximate weight for particular substances such as flour and sugar == For dry measure == Many dry ingredients such as granulated sugar are not very compressible so volume measures are consistent Others notably flour are more variable For example 1 cup of all-purpose flour sifted into a cup and leveled weighs about 100 grams ( 3½ oz ) whereas 1 cup of all-purpose flour scooped from its container and leveled weighs about 140 grams ( 5 oz ) .Using a measuring cup to measure bulk foods which can be compressed to a variable degree such as chopped vegetables or shredded cheese leads to large measurement uncertainties In cooking disciplines such as baking where accurate measurements are important ingredients are instead measured by weight == See also == Measuring spoon Cup ( unit ) Kitchen scale Spoon scale Graduated cylinder == References == == External links == WBUR story on a measuring cup design which keep a perfect ratio of surface area to volume for consistent accuracy
/m/02x984l,A fan is a powered machine used to create a flow of air A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades generally made of wood plastic or metal which act on the air The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller rotor or runner Usually it is contained within some form of housing or case This may direct the airflow or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades Most fans are powered by electric motors but other sources of power may be used including hydraulic motors handcranks and internal combustion engines Mechanically a fan can be any revolving vane or vanes used for producing currents of air Fans produce air flows with high volume and low pressure ( although higher than ambient pressure ) as opposed to compressors which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume A fan blade will often rotate when exposed to an air-fluid stream and devices that take advantage of this such as anemometers and wind turbines often have designs similar to that of a fan Typical applications include climate control and personal thermal comfort ( e.g. an electric table or floor fan ) vehicle engine cooling systems ( e.g. in front of a radiator ) machinery cooling systems ( e.g. inside computers and audio power amplifiers ) ventilation fume extraction winnowing ( e.g. separating chaff of cereal grains ) removing dust ( e.g sucking as in a vacuum cleaner ) drying ( usually in combination with a heat source ) and providing draft for a fire Some fans may be indirectly used for cooling in the case of industrial heat exchangers While fans are effective at cooling people they do not cool air but rather work by evaporative cooling of sweat and increased heat convection into the surrounding air due to the airflow from the fans Thus fans may become less effective at cooling the body if the surrounding air is near body temperature and contains high humidity == History == The punkah ( a.k.a fan ) was used in India about 500 BCE It was a handheld fan made from bamboo strips or other plant fiber that could be rotated or fanned to move air During British rule the word came to be used by Anglo-Indians to mean a large swinging flat fan fixed to the ceiling and pulled by a servant called the punkawallah For purposes of air conditioning the Han Dynasty craftsman and engineer Ding Huan ( fl 180 CE ) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3 m ( 10 ft ) in diameter in the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty ( 618–907 ) the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning while the rotary fan became even more common during the Song Dynasty ( 960–1279 ) .In the 17th century the experiments of scientists including Otto von Guericke Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle established the basic principles of vacuum and airflow The English architect Sir Christopher Wren applied an early

/m/0fx9l,A microwave oven ( commonly referred to as a microwave ) is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25–38 mm ( 1–1.5 inches ) of a homogeneous high-water-content food item The development of the cavity magnetron in the UK made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength ( microwaves ) American engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war Named the `` Radarange '' it was first sold in 1946 Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was introduced by Tappan in 1955 but it was still too large and expensive for general home use Sharp Corporation introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966 The countertop microwave oven was introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation After microwave ovens became affordable for residential use in the late 1970s their use spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world and prices fell rapidly during the 1980s In addition to cooking food microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes Microwave ovens are a common kitchen appliance and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods They rapidly heat foods which can easily burn or turn lumpy if cooked in conventional pans such as hot butter fats chocolate or porridge Microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food since they rarely attain the necessary temperature to produce Maillard reactions Exceptions occur in cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other oily items ( such as bacon ) which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.Microwave ovens have a limited role in professional cooking because the boiling-range temperatures of a microwave oven does not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying browning or baking at a higher temperature produces However such high heat sources can be added to microwave ovens in the form of a convection microwave oven == History == === Early developments === The exploitation of high-frequency radio waves for heating substances was made possible by the development of vacuum tube radio transmitters around 1920 By 1930 the application of short waves to heat human tissue had developed into the medical therapy of diathermy At the 1933 Chicago World 's Fair Westinghouse demonstrated the cooking of foods between two metal plates attached to a 10 kW 60 MHz shortwave transmitter The Westinghouse team led by I.

/m/01tcjp,A Mufti ( Arabic مفتي ) is an Islamic jurist qualified to issue a nonbinding opinion ( fatwa ) on a point of Islamic law ( sharia ) The act of issuing fatwas is called iftāʾ Muftis and their fatwas played an important role throughout Islamic history taking on new roles in the modern era.Tracing its origins to the Quran and early Islamic communities the practice of ifta crystallized with the emergence of the traditional legal theory and schools of Islamic jurisprudence ( madhahib ) In the classical legal system fatwas issued by muftis in response to private queries served to inform Muslim populations about Islam advise courts on difficult points of Islamic law and elaborate substantive law In later times muftis also issued public and political fatwas that took a stand on doctrinal controversies legitimized government policies or articulated grievances of the population.Traditionally a mufti was seen as a scholar of upright character who possessed a thorough knowledge of the Quran hadith and legal literature Muftis acted as independent scholars in the classical legal system Over the centuries Sunni muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies while Shia jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.With the spread of codified state laws and Western-style legal education in the modern Muslim world muftis generally no longer play their traditional role of clarifying and elaborating the laws applied in courts However muftis have continued to advise the general public on other aspects of sharia particularly questions regarding religious rituals and everyday life Some modern muftis are appointed by the state to issue fatwas while others serve on advisory religious councils Still others issue fatwas in response to private queries on television or over the internet Modern public fatwas have addressed and sometimes sparked controversies in the Muslim world and beyond.The legal methodology of modern ifta often diverges from pre-modern practice While the proliferation of contemporary fatwas attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims little research has been done to determine to what extent the Muslim public continues to acknowledge the religious authority of muftis or heeds their advice == Terminology == The word mufti comes from the Arabic root f-t-y whose meanings include `` youth newness clarification explanation '' A number of related terms derive from the same root A mufti 's response is called a fatwa The person who asks a mufti for a fatwa is known as mustafti The act of issuing fatwas is called iftāʾ The term futyā refers to soliciting and issuing fatwas == Origins == The origins of muftis and the fatwa can be traced back to the Quran On a number of occasions the Quranic text instructs the Islamic prophet Muhammad how to respond to questions from his followers regarding religious and social practices Several of these verses begin with the phrase `` When they ask you concerning ... say ... '' In two cases ( 4:127 4:176 ) this is expressed with verbal forms of the root f-t-y which signify asking for or giving an authoritative answer
/m/02jvh9,A jug is a type of container commonly used to hold liquids It has an opening sometimes narrow from which to pour or drink and has a handle and often a pouring lip Jugs throughout history have been made of metal and ceramic or glass and plastic is now common In British English jugs are pouring vessels for holding drinkable liquids whether beer water or soft drinks In North American English these table jugs are usually called pitchers Ewer is an older word for jugs or pitchers and there are several others Several other types of containers are also called jugs depending on locale tradition and personal preference Some types of bottles can be called jugs particularly if the container has a narrow mouth and has a handle Closures such as stoppers or screw caps are common for these retail packages == Etymology == The word jug is first recorded in the late 15th century as jugge or jubbe It is of unknown origin but perhaps comes from jug a term for a maidservant in the same period This in turn comes from the alteration of common personal names such as Joan or Judith == Beer == In certain countries especially New Zealand and Australia a `` jug '' refers to a plastic container filled with two pints ( just over a litre ) of beer It is usually served along with one or more small glasses from which the beer is normally consumed although in some student bars it is more common for the beer to be drunk directly from the jug which is usually served without the accompanying glass ( In the U.S. this may be called a pitcher—although few US pitchers are as small as a litre generally holding between 64 and 128 U.S. fluid ounces approximately 2-4 litres In New Zealand and Australia a pitcher sometimes can refer to a much larger measure of beer ) In Britain in those parts of the country where there is a choice between a pint ( 20 fluid ounces ) tankard and a straight glass of beer a tankard may be called a tankard or a `` jug '' A jug of beer may also refer to a jug containing larger amounts ( usually sized in pints ) but if a large jug is sold it will be advertised as such in the pub and this helps to reduce confusion == Music == In American folk music an empty jug ( often stoneware used for American whiskey ) is sometimes used as a musical instrument being played with buzzed lips to produce a trombone-like tone It is often part of a jug band to which ensemble it lends its name == Examples == A variety of containers are sometimes called “ jugs ” == See also == == References == == External links == '' Jug '' Encyclopedia Americana 1920
/m/0dbzx,Male ( symbol ♂ ) is the sex of an organism that produces the gamete ( sex cell ) known as sperm which fuses with the larger female gamete or ovum in the process of fertilization A male organism can not reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually Most male mammals including male humans have a Y chromosome which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs Not all species share a common sex-determination system In most animals including humans sex is determined genetically however species such as Cymothoa exigua change sex depending on the number of females present in the vicinity.In humans the word male can also be used to refer to gender in the social sense of gender role or gender identity == Overview == The existence of separate sexes has evolved independently at different times and in different lineages an example of convergent evolution The repeated pattern is sexual reproduction in isogamous species with two or more mating types with gametes of identical form and behavior ( but different at the molecular level ) to anisogamous species with gametes of male and female types to oogamous species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.Accordingly sex is defined across species by the type of gametes produced ( i.e spermatozoa vs. ova ) and differences between males and females in one lineage are not always predictive of differences in another.Male/female dimorphism between organisms or reproductive organs of different sexes is not limited to animals male gametes are produced by chytrids diatoms and land plants among others In land plants female and male designate not only the female and male gamete-producing organisms and structures but also the structures of the sporophytes that give rise to male and female plants == Evolution == The evolution of anisogamy led to the evolution of male and female function Before the evolution of anisogamy mating types in a species were isogamous the same size and both could move catalogued only as `` + '' or `` '' types In anisogamy the mating type is called a gamete The male gamete is smaller than the female gamete and usually mobile Anisogamy remains poorly understood as there is no fossil record of its emergence Numerous theories exist as to why anisogamy emerged Many share a common thread in that larger female gametes are more likely to survive and that smaller male gametes are more likely to find other gametes because they can travel faster Current models often fail to account for why isogamy remains in a few species Anisogamy appears to have evolved multiple times from isogamy for example female Volvocales ( a type of green algae ) evolved from the plus mating type Although sexual evolution emerged at
/m/057cc,A musical keyboard is the set of adjacent depressible levers or keys on a musical instrument Keyboards typically contain keys for playing the twelve notes of the Western musical scale with a combination of larger longer keys and smaller shorter keys that repeats at the interval of an octave Pressing a key on the keyboard makes the instrument produce sounds—either by mechanically striking a string or tine ( acoustic and electric piano clavichord ) plucking a string ( harpsichord ) causing air to flow through a pipe organ striking a bell ( carillon ) or on electric and electronic keyboards completing a circuit ( Hammond organ digital piano synthesizer ) Since the most commonly encountered keyboard instrument is the piano the keyboard layout is often referred to as the piano keyboard == Description == The twelve notes of the Western musical scale are laid out with the lowest note on the left The longer keys ( for the seven `` natural '' notes of the C major scale C D E F G A B ) jut forward Because these keys were traditionally covered in ivory they are often called the white notes or white keys The keys for the remaining five notes—which are not part of the C major scale— ( i.e. C♯/D♭ D♯/E♭ F♯/G♭ G♯/A♭ A♯/B♭ ) ( see Sharp and Flat ) are raised and shorter Black keys form a pentatonic scale Because these keys receive less wear they are often made of black colored wood and called the black notes or black keys The pattern repeats at the interval of an octave The arrangement of longer keys for C major with intervening shorter keys for the intermediate semitones dates to the 15th century Many keyboard instruments dating from before the nineteenth century such as harpsichords and pipe organs have a keyboard with the colours of the keys reversed the white notes are made of ebony and the black notes are covered with softer white bone A few electric and electronic instruments from the 1960s and subsequent decades have also done this Vox 's electronic organs of the 1960s Farfisa 's FAST portable organs Hohner 's Clavinet L one version of Korg 's Poly-800 synthesizer and Roland 's digital harpsichords Some 1960s electronic organs used reverse colors or gray sharps or naturals to indicate the lower part ( or parts ) of a single keyboard divided into two parts each controlling a different registration or sound Such keyboards accommodate melody and contrasting accompaniment without the expense of a second manual and were a regular feature in Spanish and some English organs of the renaissance and baroque eras The break was between middle C and C-sharp or outside of Iberia between B and C. Broken keyboards reappeared in 1842 with the harmonium the split occurring at E4/F4 The reverse-colored keys on Hammond organs such as the B3 C3 and A100 are latch-style radio buttons for selecting pre-set sounds == Size and historical variation == The chromatic range ( also called compass ) of keyboard instruments has tended to increase Harpsichords
/m/05bm6,In woodworking and construction a nail is a small object made of metal ( or wood called a tree nail or `` trunnel '' ) which is used as a fastener as a peg to hang something or sometimes as a decoration Generally nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other but headless nails are available Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes The most common is a wire nail Other types of nails include pins tacks brads spikes and cleats Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer or nail gun A nail holds materials together by friction in the axial direction and shear strength laterally The point of the nail is also sometimes bent over or clinched after driving to prevent pulling out == History == The history of the nail is divided roughly into three distinct periods Hand-wrought ( forged ) nail ( pre-history until 19th century ) Cut nail ( roughly 1800 to 1914 ) Wire nail ( roughly 1860 to the present ) From the late 1700s to the mid-1900s nail prices fell by a factor of 10 since then nail prices have increased slightly reflecting in part an upturn in materials prices and a shift toward specialty nails === Hand wrought === The Bible provides a number of references to nails including the story in Judges of Jael the wife of Heber who drives a nail ( or tent-peg ) into the temple of a sleeping Canaanite commander the provision of iron for nails by King David for what would become Solomon 's Temple and in connection with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ The Romans made extensive use of nails The Roman army for example left behind seven tons of nails when it evacuated the fortress of Inchtuthil in Perthshire in the United Kingdom in 86 to 87 CE The term `` penny '' as it refers to nails probably originated in medieval England to describe the price of a hundred nails Nails themselves were sufficiently valuable and standardized to be used as an informal medium of exchange Until around 1800 artisans known as nailers or nailors made nails by hand – note the surname Naylor ( Workmen called slitters cut up iron bars to a suitable size for nailers to work on From the late 16th century manual slitters disappeared with the rise of the slitting mill which cut bars of iron into rods with an even cross-section saving much manual effort ) At the time of the American Revolution England was the largest manufacturer of nails in the world Nails were expensive and difficult to obtain in the American colonies so that abandoned houses were sometimes deliberately burned down to allow recovery of used nails from the ashes This became such a problem in Virginia that a law was created to stop people from burning their houses when they moved Families often had small nail-manufacturing setups in their homes during bad weather and at night the entire family might work

/m/05kms,The oboe ( OH-boh ) is a type of double reed woodwind instrument Oboes are usually made of wood but may also be made of synthetic materials such as plastic resin or hybrid composites The most common oboe plays in C using the treble clef but other members of the oboe family play in different keys such as the English Horn which is in the key of F. All oboes in the oboe family read in treble clef regardless of range to allow oboists to read on all oboe family instruments effectively A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm ( 25+1⁄2 in ) long with metal keys a conical bore and a flared bell Sound is produced by blowing into the reed at a sufficient air pressure causing it to vibrate with the air column The distinctive tone is versatile and has been described as `` bright '' When the word oboe is used alone it is generally taken to mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family such as the bass oboe the cor anglais ( English horn ) or oboe d'amore Today the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in symphony orchestras concert bands and chamber ensembles The oboe is especially used in classical music film music some genres of folk music and is occasionally heard in jazz rock pop and popular music The oboe is widely recognized as the instrument that tunes the orchestra with its distinctive A'.A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist == Sound == In comparison to other modern woodwind instruments the treble oboe is sometimes referred to as having a `` bright and penetrating '' voice The Sprightly Companion an instruction book published by Henry Playford in 1695 describes the oboe as `` Majestical and Stately and not much Inferior to the Trumpet '' In the play Angels in America the sound is described as like `` that of a duck if the duck were a songbird '' The rich timbre is derived from its conical bore ( as opposed to the generally cylindrical bore of flutes and clarinets ) As a result oboes are easier to hear over other instruments in large ensembles due to its penetrating sound The highest note is a semitone lower than the nominally highest note of the B♭ clarinet Since the clarinet has a wider range the lowest note of the B♭ clarinet is significantly deeper ( a minor sixth ) than the lowest note of the oboe.Music for the standard oboe is written in concert pitch ( i.e. it is not a transposing instrument ) and the instrument has a soprano range usually from B♭3 to G6 Orchestras tune to a concert A played by the first oboe According to the League of American Orchestras this is done because the pitch is secure and its penetrating sound makes it ideal for tuning The pitch of the oboe is affected by the way in which the reed is made The reed has a significant effect on the sound Variations in

/m/080n7g,A paper cutter also known as a paper guillotine or simply a guillotine is a tool often found in offices and classrooms designed to administer straight cuts to single sheets or large stacks of paper at once == History == Paper cutters were developed and patented in 1844 by French inventor Guillaume Massiquot Later Milton Bradley went on to patent his own version of the paper cutter in 1879 Since the middle of the 19th century considerable improvements to the paper cutter have been made by Fomm and Krause of Germany Furnival in England and Oswego and Seybold in the United States == Description == Paper cutters vary in size usually from about 30 centimetres ( 1 ft ) in length on each side for office work to 841 millimetres ( 33.1 in ) ( an edge of A1 paper ) in design workshops The surface will typically have a grid either painted or inscribed on it and may have a ruler across the top At the very least it must have a flat edge against which the user may line up the paper at right angles before passing it under the blade It is typically relatively heavy so that it will remain steady while in use On the right-hand edge is a long curved steel blade often referred to as a knife attached to the base at one corner Larger versions have a strong compression coil spring as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper The other end of the knife unit is a handle The stationary right edge of the base is also steel with an exposed finely-ground edge When the knife is pulled down to cut paper the action resembles that of a pair of scissors only instead of two knives moving against each other one is stationary The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page Paper cutters are also used for cutting thin sheet metal cardboard and plastic The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel which provides long-term durability The steel blade can be resharpened as needed A variant design uses a wheel-shaped blade mounted on a sliding shuttle attached to a rail This type of paper cutter is known as a rotary paper cutter Advantages of this design include being able to make wavy cuts and perforations or to simply to score the paper without cutting merely by substituting various types of circular blades With a rotary cutter it is also almost impossible for the user to cut oneself except while changing the blade This makes it safer for home use Higher-end versions of rotary paper cutters are used for precision paper cutting and are popular for trimming photographs An even simpler design uses double-edged blades which do not rotate but cut like a penknife While cheaper this design is not preferable
/m/02w3r3,A paper towel is an absorbent disposable towel made from paper In Britain paper towels for kitchen use are also known as kitchen rolls kitchen paper or kitchen towels For home use paper towels are usually sold in a roll of perforated sheets but some are sold in stacks of pre-cut and pre-folded layers for use in paper-towel dispensers Unlike cloth towels paper towels are disposable and intended to be used only once Paper towels absorb water because they are loosely woven which enables water to travel between the fibers even against gravity ( capillary effect ) They have similar purposes to conventional towels such as drying hands wiping windows and other surfaces dusting and cleaning up spills Paper towel dispensers are commonly used in toilet facilities shared by many people as they are often considered more hygienic than hot-air hand dryers or shared cloth towels == History == In 1907 the Scott Paper Company of Philadelphia Pennsylvania introduced paper tissues to help prevent the spread of colds from cloth towels in restrooms Popular belief is that this was partly accidental and was the solution to a railroad car full of long paper rolls meant for toilet paper that were unsuitable to cut into such In 1919 William E. Corbin Henry Chase and Harold Titus began experimenting with paper towels in the Research and Development building of the Brown Company in Berlin New Hampshire By 1922 Corbin perfected their product and began mass-producing it at the Cascade Mill on the Berlin/Gorham line This product was called Nibroc Paper Towels ( Corbin spelled backwards ) In 1931 the Scott Paper Company of Philadelphia Pennsylvania introduced their paper towel rolls for kitchens In 1995 Kimberly-Clark acquired Scott Paper Company == Production == Paper towels are made from either virgin or recycled paper pulp which is extracted from wood or fiber crops They are sometimes bleached during the production process to lighten coloration and may also be decorated with colored images on each square ( such as flowers or teddy bears ) Resin size is used to improve the wet strength Paper towels are packed individually and sold as stacks or are held on a continuous roll and come in two distinct classes domestic and institutional Many companies produce paper towels Some common brand names are Bounty Seventh Generation Scott and Viva among many others == Market == Tissue products in North America including paper towels are divided into consumer and commercial markets with household consumer usage accounting for approximately two thirds of total North American consumption Commercial usage or otherwise any use outside of the household accounts for the remaining third of North American consumption The growth in commercial use of paper towels can be attributed to the migration from folded towels ( in public bathrooms for example ) to roll towel dispensers which reduces the amount of paper towels used by each patron.Within the forest products industry paper towels are a major part of the `` tissue market '' second only to toilet paper.Globally Americans are the highest per capita users of paper
/m/0cyfs,A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag or in a ram-air parachute aerodynamic lift A major application is to support people for recreation or as a safety device for aviators who can exit from an aircraft at height and descend safely to earth A parachute is usually made of a light strong fabric Early parachutes were made of silk The most common fabric today is nylon A parachute 's canopy is typically dome-shaped but some are rectangles inverted domes and other shapes A variety of loads are attached to parachutes including people food equipment space capsules and bombs == History == === Middle Ages === In 852 in Córdoba Spain the Moorish man Armen Firman attempted unsuccessfully to fly by jumping from a tower while wearing a large cloak It was recorded that `` there was enough air in the folds of his cloak to prevent great injury when he reached the ground '' === Early Renaissance === The earliest evidence for the true parachute dates back to the Renaissance period The oldest parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s Renaissance Italy ( British Library Add MS 34113 fol 200v ) showing a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy As a safety measure four straps ran from the ends of the rods to a waist belt The design is a marked improvement over another folio ( 189v ) which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall using two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars which he grips with his hands Although the surface area of the parachute design appears to be too small to offer effective air resistance and the wooden base-frame is superfluous and potentially harmful the basic concept of a working parachute is apparent.Shortly after a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus ( fol 381v ) dated to ca 1485 Here the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper A square wooden frame which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal held open Leonardo 's canopy It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among artist-engineers of the time The feasibility of Leonardo 's pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by Briton Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by the Swiss skydiver Olivier Vietti-Teppa According to historian of technology Lynn White these conical and pyramidal designs much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia mark the origin of `` the parachute as we know it '' The Venetian polymath and inventor Fausto Veranzio or Faust Vrančić ( 1551–1617 ) examined da Vinci 's parachute sketch and kept the square frame but replaced the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth that he came to realize decelerates a fall more effectively

Babson on August 30 1928 The meter was intended to operate on power from the battery of the parking vehicle and required a connection from the vehicle to the meter Holger George Thuesen and Gerald A. Hale designed the first working parking meter the Black Maria in 1935 The History Channel 's ... History 's Lost and Found documents their success in developing the first working parking meter Thuesen and Hale were engineering professors at Oklahoma State University and began working on the parking meter in 1933 at the request of Oklahoma City Oklahoma lawyer and newspaper publisher Carl C. Magee The world 's first installed parking meter was in Oklahoma City on July 16 1935 Magee received a patent for the apparatus on 24 May 1938.Industrial production started in 1936 and expanded until the mid-1980s The first models were based on a coin acceptor a dial to engage the mechanism and a visible pointer and flag to indicate expiration of paid period This configuration lasted for more than 40 years with only a few changes in the exterior design such as a double-headed design ( to cover two adjacent parking spaces ) and the incorporation of new materials and production techniques.M.H Rhodes Inc. of Hartford Connecticut started making meters for Mark-Time Parking Meter Company of Miami where the first Rhodes meters were installed in 1936 These were different from the Magee design because only the driver 's action of turning a handle was necessary to keep the spring wound while Magee 's meters needed a serviceman to wind the spring occasionally Upon insertion of coins into a currency detector slot or swiping a credit card or smartcard into a slot and turning a handle ( or pressing a key ) a timer is initiated within the meter Some locations now allow payment by mobile phone ( to remotely record payments for subsequent checking and enforcement ) A dial or display on the meter indicates the time remaining In many cities all parking meters are designed to use only one type of coin Use of other coins will fail to register and the meter may cease to function altogether For example in Hackensack New Jersey all parking meters are designed for quarters only.In 1960 New York City hired its first crew of `` meter maids '' all were women It was not until 1967 that the first man was hired.In the mid-1980s a digital version was introduced replacing the mechanical parts with electronic components boards keyboards and displays This allowed more flexibility to the meter as an EEPROM chip can be reconfigured more easily
/m/0hnyx,Pastry is baked food made with a dough of flour water and shortening ( solid fats including butter or lard ) that may be savoury or sweetened Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers confectionery The word `` pastries '' suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour sugar milk butter shortening baking powder and eggs Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries as a synecdoche Common pastry dishes include pies tarts quiches croissants and pasties.The French word pâtisserie is also used in English ( with or without the accent ) for the same foods Originally the French word pastisserie referred to anything such as a meat pie made in dough ( paste later pâte ) and not typically a luxurious or sweet product This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today Pastry can also refer to the pastry dough from which such baked products are made Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products Pastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture A good pastry is light and airy and fatty but firm enough to support the weight of the filling When making a shortcrust pastry care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten On the other hand overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for yeast bread spreading it with butter and folding it to produce many thin layers == Types == Shortcrust pastry Shortcrust pastry is the simplest and most common pastry It is made with flour fat butter salt and water to bind the dough pâte brisée is the French version of classic pie or tart shortcrust pastry The process of making pastry includes mixing of the fat and flour adding water chilling and then rolling out the dough Chilling before rolling is essential since it enables the fat ( lard butter etc ) to harden again and thus create flaky layers in the dough It also allows for even hydration and inhibits gluten formation This results in a tender flaky pastry The fat is mixed with the flour first generally by rubbing with fingers or a pastry blender which inhibits gluten formation by coating the gluten strands in fat and results in a short ( as in crumbly hence the term shortcrust ) tender pastry A related type is the sweetened sweetcrust pastry also known as pâte sucrée in which sugar and egg yolks have been added ( rather than water ) to bind the pastry Flaky pastry Flaky pastry is a simple pastry that expands when cooked due to the number of
/m/0dj6p,Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence In a social sense peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict ( such as war ) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups Throughout history leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict greater economic interactivity and consequently substantial prosperity `` Psychological peace '' ( such as peaceful thinking and emotions ) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing `` behavioural peace '' Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a `` peaceful inner disposition '' Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life The acquisition of such a `` peaceful internal disposition '' for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests Peace is not a state of excitement although we are happy when excited but peace is when one 's mind is quiet and satisfied == Etymology == The term 'peace originates most recently from the Anglo-French pes and the Old French pais meaning `` peace reconciliation silence agreement '' ( 11th century ) The Anglo-French term pes itself comes from the Latin pax meaning `` peace compact agreement treaty of peace tranquility absence of hostility harmony '' The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c. 1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word shalom which according to Jewish theology comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete whole Although 'peace is the usual translation however it is an incomplete one because 'shalom which is also cognate with the Arabic salaam has multiple other meanings in addition to peace including justice good health safety well-being prosperity equity security good fortune and friendliness as well as simply the greetings `` hello '' and `` goodbye '' On a personal level peaceful behaviours are kind considerate respectful just and tolerant of others beliefs and behaviors – tending to manifest goodwill This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual 's introspective sense or concept of her/himself as in being `` at peace '' in one 's own mind as found in European references from c. 1200 The early English term is also used in the sense of `` quiet '' reflecting calm serene and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek tranquility an absence of disturbance or agitation In many languages the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell for example the Hawaiian word aloha as well as the Arabic word salaam In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell especially for the dead as in the phrase rest in peace Wolfgang Dietrich in his research project which led
/m/061_f,A pearl is a hard glistening object produced within the soft tissue ( specifically the mantle ) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal such as fossil conulariids Just like the shell of a mollusk a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate ( mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite ) in minute crystalline form which has deposited in concentric layers The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth but many other shapes known as baroque pearls can occur The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries Because of this pearl has become a metaphor for something rare fine admirable and valuable The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild but are extremely rare These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry but in the past were also used to adorn clothing They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics medicines and paint formulations Whether wild or cultured gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent like the interior of the shell that produces them However almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls ( technically `` calcareous concretions '' ) of lesser shine or less spherical shape Although these may also be legitimately referred to as `` pearls '' by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules and are formed in the same way most of them have no value except as curiosities == Etymology == The English word pearl comes from the French perle originally from the Latin perna meaning leg after the ham- or mutton leg-shaped bivalve.The scientific name for the family of pearl-bearing oysters Margaritiferidae comes from the Old Persian word for pearl * margārīta- which is the source of the English name Margaret == Definition == All shelled mollusks can by natural processes produce some kind of `` pearl '' when an irritating microscopic object becomes trapped within its mantle folds but the great majority of these `` pearls '' are not valued as gemstones Nacreous pearls the best-known and most commercially significant are primarily produced by two groups of molluskan bivalves or clams A nacreous pearl is made from layers of nacre by the same living process as is used in the secretion of the mother of pearl which lines the shell Natural ( or wild ) pearls formed without human intervention are very rare Many hundreds of pearl oysters or mussels must be gathered and opened and thus killed to find even one wild pearl for many centuries this was the only way pearls were obtained and why pearls fetched such extraordinary prices in the past Cultured pearls are formed in pearl farms using human intervention as well as natural processes One family of nacreous pearl bivalves – the pearl oyster – lives in

/m/02ddwp,A pencil sharpener ( also referred to as pencil pointer or in Ireland as a parer or topper ) is a tool for sharpening a pencil 's writing point by shaving away its worn surface Pencil sharpeners may be operated manually or by an electric motor It is common for many sharpeners to have a casing around them which can be removed for emptying the pencil shavings debris into a bin == History == Before the development of dedicated pencil sharpeners a pencil was sharpened by whittling with a knife The development of pencil sharpeners began in France when a French book from 1822 reported in detail about an invention of Mr. C. A. Boucher ( Paris ) for the construction of a pencil sharpener He was working with pantographs and apparently needed a device to precisely sharpen the pencils The device of Mr. Boucher was technically sensible and functional His idea was also internationally known and recognized as shown by corresponding reports in German literature at this time But Mr. Boucher had not applied a patent for his pencil sharpener Commercial use of his inventions is unlikely French mathematician Bernard Lassimonne ( Limoges ) applied the world 's first patent ( French patent # 2444 ) on a pencil sharpener in 1828 Pencil sharpener devices using his patent were actually produced and sold by Binant a shop for painting accessories in Paris In 1833 in England Cooper & Eckstein patented the so-called Styloxynon a simple device consisting of two sharp files set together at right angle in a small block of rosewood This is the oldest pencil sharpener that has surviving examples.In the 1830s and 1840s some French people all based in Paris were engaged in construction of simple pencil sharpening tools like François Joseph Lahausse These devices were partially sold but without supra-regional significance In 1847 the French nobleman Thierry des Estivaux invented a simple hand-held pencil sharpener in its recognizable modern form The first American pencil sharpener was patented by Walter Kittredge Foster of Bangor Maine in 1855 He founded a company – the first pencil sharpener company in the world – and produced such small hand-held pencil sharpeners in a large amount Only a few years later the sharpeners were sold also in Europe as `` American pencil sharpeners '' .At the end of the 19th century especially in the United States pencil sharpeners with various mechanisms had been developed and put on the market These devices were often heavy and intended for use in offices Examples are the Perfect Pencil Pointer ( Goodell Co. ) the GEM Pencil Sharpener ( by Gould & Cook Co. ) the Planetary Pencil Sharpener ( A B. Dick Co. ) all from the USA or the Jupiter ( Guhl & Harbeck Co. ) from Germany At the beginning of the 20th century the company Automatic Pencil Sharpener Co. ( APSCO ) was founded and brought out the US Automatic Pencil Sharpener after 1907 which dominated in those years Later they sold machines with milling mechanisms such as the Climax Dexter Wizard

[ a ] n Italian monk invents pretzels as a reward to children who learn their prayers He calls the strips of baked dough folded to resemble arms crossing the chest 'pretiola ( 'little reward [ s ] ) '' Another source locates the invention in a monastery in southern France In Germany there are stories that pretzels were the invention of desperate bakers held hostage by local dignitaries.The German name `` Brezel '' may derive also from Latin bracellus ( a medieval term for 'bracelet ) or bracchiola ( 'little arms ) The pretzel has been in use as an emblem of bakers and formerly their guilds in southern German areas since at least the 12th century A 12th century illustration of the banquet of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus in the Hortus deliciarum from the Alsace region ( today France ) may contain the earliest depiction of a pretzel Within the Christian Church pretzels were regarded as having religious significance for both ingredients and shape Pretzels made with a simple recipe using only flour and water could be eaten during Lent when Christians were forbidden to eat eggs lard or dairy products such as milk and butter ( cf Daniel Fast ) As time passed pretzels became associated with both Lent and Easter Pretzels were hidden on Easter morning just as eggs are hidden today and are particularly associated with Lent fasting and prayers before Easter.Like the holes in the hubs of round Finnish flat bread ruisreikäleipä which let them be hung on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling the loops in pretzels may have served a practical purpose bakers could hang them on sticks for instance projecting upwards from a central column as shown in a painting by Job Berckheyde ( 1630–1693 ) from around 1681 === Emblem of the
/m/01m4t,"Painting is the practice of applying paint pigment color or other medium to a solid surface ( called the `` matrix '' or `` support '' ) The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but other implements such as knives sponges and airbrushes can be used In art the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action ( the final work is called `` a painting '' ) The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls paper canvas wood glass lacquer pottery leaf copper and concrete and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand clay paper plaster gold leaf and even whole objects Painting is an important form in the visual arts bringing in elements such as drawing composition gesture ( as in gestural painting ) narration ( as in narrative art ) and abstraction ( as in abstract art ) Paintings can be naturalistic and representational ( as in still life and landscape painting ) photographic abstract narrative symbolistic ( as in Symbolist art ) emotive ( as in Expressionism ) or political in nature ( as in Artivism ) A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling to scenes from the life of Buddha ( or other images of Eastern religious origin ) == History == The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old found in both the Franco-Cantabrian region in western Europe and in the caves in the district of Maros ( Sulawesi Indonesia ) In November 2018 however scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting over 40,000 ( perhaps as old as 52,000 ) years old of an unknown animal in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo ( Kalimantan ) In December 2019 figurative cave paintings depicting pig hunting in the Maros-Pangkep karst in Sulawesi were estimated to be even older at at least 43,900 years old The finding was noted to be “ the oldest pictorial record of storytelling and the earliest figurative artwork in the world ” More recently in 2021 cave art of a pig found in an Indonesian island and dated to over 45,500 years has been reported However the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in Arnhem Land in northern Australia In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the Kimberley region of North-Western Australia that is dated 40,000 years old There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Indonesia France Spain Portugal Italy China India Australia Mexico etc In Western cultures oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter In the East ink and"
/m/0420v5,A punching bag ( or British English punchbag ) is a sturdy bag designed to be repeatedly punched A punching bag is usually cylindrical and filled with various materials of suitable hardness == History == Punching bags have been used in martial arts and swordplay for the entire written history of military training Similar apparatus in Asian martial arts include the Okinawan makiwara and the Chinese mook jong which may have padded striking surfaces attached to them.In martial arts and combat sports—such as karate sanda taekwondo and Muay Thai— '' heavy '' bags standing bags and similar apparatuses have been adapted for practicing kicking and other striking maneuvers in addition to developing punching technique == Construction == Punching bags are often filled with grains sand rags or other material and are usually hung from the ceiling or affixed to a stand Other bags have an internal bladder to allow them to be filled with air or water The design of a punching bag allows it to take repeated and constant physical abuse without breaking The bag must also absorb the impact of blows without causing harm to the user == Types == There are different types of punching bags with different names based on their size use and mounting method Almost all punching bags are covered with either leather or synthetic materials such as vinyl which resist abrasion and mildew Canvas can also be used as a bag material where there is lower use and humidity Speed bags ( AKA speedballs ) are small air-filled bags anchored at the top to a rebound platform parallel to the ground Speed bags help a fighter learn to keep their hands up improve hand-eye coordination and learn to shift weight between feet when punching They are also known as speedballs or speed ball bags They are generally filled with air and fitted around a tight PU-based or leather material They come in various sizes ranging from the large 13×10″ ( 33×25 cm ) and 12×9″ midsize 11×8″ 10×7″ ( 25×18 cm ) and 9×6″ to the small 8×5″ 7×4″ and 6×4″ ( 15×10 cm ) Generally the larger the bag the slower it is and the more force is required to keep it going Large bags are used more for building strength and endurance while smaller bags allow the training athlete to focus on faster hand speed timing and coordination Beginners might view this bag more as a `` control bag '' not a speed bag for they will not be able to punch both quickly and repetitively until they gain control over their swinging force and speed A boxer normally hits the speed bag from the front with his or her fists but it is also possible to use fists and elbows to hit the bag from all around it including the front back and sides In this method the user may perform many diverse punching combinations that create improvised rhythmic accents Although speed bags are normally hung vertically recently the additional method of hanging a bag horizontally on a wall has regained popularity

/m/02bm9n,A ratchet ( occasionally spelled rachet ) is a mechanical device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion in only one direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools The word ratchet is also used informally to refer to a ratcheting socket wrench == Theory of operation == A ratchet consists of a round gear or a linear rack with teeth and a pivoting spring-loaded finger called a pawl ( or click in clocks and watches ) that engages the teeth The teeth are uniform but are usually asymmetrical with each tooth having a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the other edge When the teeth are moving in the unrestricted ( i.e forward ) direction the pawl easily slides up and over the gently sloped edges of the teeth with a spring forcing it ( often with an audible 'click ) into the depression between the teeth as it passes the tip of each tooth When the teeth move in the opposite ( backward ) direction however the pawl will catch against the steeply sloped edge of the first tooth it encounters thereby locking it against the tooth and preventing any further motion in that direction === Backlash === Because the ratchet can only stop backward motion at discrete points ( i.e. at tooth boundaries ) a ratchet does allow a limited amount of backward motion This backward motion—which is limited to a maximum distance equal to the spacing between the teeth—is called backlash In cases where backlash must be minimized a smooth toothless ratchet with a high friction surface such as rubber is sometimes used The pawl bears against the surface at an angle so that any backward motion will cause the pawl to jam against the surface and thus prevent any further backward motion Since the backward travel distance is primarily a function of the compressibility of the high friction surface this mechanism can result in significantly reduced backlash == Uses == Ratchet mechanisms are used in a wide variety of applications including these Cable ties Capstans Caulking guns Clocks Freewheel ( overrunning clutch ) Grease guns Handcuffs Jacks Anti-rollback devices used in roller coasters Looms Slacklines Socket wrenches Tie down straps Turnstiles Typewriters == Gallery == == See also == Brownian ratchet Freewheel Sprag clutch Check valve a device that allows fluids to flow in only one direction Diode a device that allows electric current to flow in only one direction == References ==

/m/06c54,A rifle is a long-barreled firearm designed for accurate shooting with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves ( rifling ) cut into the bore wall In keeping with their focus on accuracy rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter 's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting Rifles are used extensively in warfare law enforcement hunting shooting sports and crime The term was originally rifled gun with the verb rifle referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools By the 20th century the weapon had become so common that the modern noun rifle is now often used for any long-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger ( e.g. personnel halting and stimulation response rifle which is actually a laser dazzler ) Like all typical firearms a rifle 's projectile ( bullet ) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound ( originally black powder later cordite and now nitrocellulose ) although other propulsive means are used such as compressed air in air rifles which are popular for vermin control small game hunting competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting ( plinking ) The distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier smoothbore long guns ( e.g. arquebuses muskets ) is the rifling within its barrel The raised areas of a barrel 's rifling are called lands they make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore imparting a spin When the projectile leaves the barrel this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum increasing accuracy and hence effective range Early long rifles were muzzle-loaders firing spherical balls the introduction of breech-loading allowed the use of elongated and aerodynamically efficient bullets which did not yaw or tumble significantly in flight due to the spin == Terminology == Historically rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger Modern rifles are commonly classified as single-shot bolt-action semi-automatic or automatic Single-shot bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles are limited by their designs to fire a single shot for each trigger pull Only automatic rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger squeeze however some automatic rifles are limited to fixed bursts of two three or more rounds per squeeze Modern automatic rifles overlap to some extent in design and function with machine guns In fact many light machine guns ( such as the Russian RPK ) are adaptations of existing automatic rifle designs A military 's light machine guns are typically chambered for the same caliber ammunition as its service rifles Generally the difference between an automatic rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight cooling system and ammunition feed system Rifles with their relatively lighter components ( which overheat quickly ) and smaller capacity magazines are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are they trade this capability in favor of increased mobility Modern

/m/02p3w7d,Roller skates are shoes or bindings that fit onto shoes that are worn to enable the wearer to roll along on wheels The first roller skate was an inline skate design effectively an ice skate with wheels replacing the blade Later the `` quad skate '' style became more popular consisting of four wheels arranged in the same configuration as a typical car Roller skating is a hobby sport and mode of transportation using roller skates == History == While the first reported use of wheeled skates was on a London stage in 1743 the first patented `` roller skate '' was introduced in 1760 by Belgian inventor John Joseph Merlin They were hard to steer and stopping was difficult due to the fact that they did not have any type of braking mechanism and as such they failed to gain popularity Merlin demonstrated his invention during a party in the city of Huy during which he skated while playing the violin.In the 1840s Meyerbeer 's opera Le prophète featured a scene in which performers used roller-skates to simulate ice-skating on a frozen lake set on stage This exposure had an impact on audiences and led to the rise of roller skating as a new and popular activity throughout the Continent As ice skaters subsequently developed the art of figure skating roller skaters wanted the ability to turn in their skates in a similar fashion.In 1863 James Plimpton from Massachusetts invented the `` rocking '' skate and used a four-wheel configuration for stability and independent axles that turned by pressing to one side of the skate or the other when the skater wants to create an edge This was a vast improvement on the Merlin design one that was easier to use and drove the huge popularity of roller skating dubbed `` rinkomania '' in the 1860s and 1870s which spread to Europe and around the world and continued through the 1930s The Plimpton skate is still used today Eventually roller skating evolved from just a pastime to a competitive sport speed skating racing on skates and inline figure skating very similar to what can be seen in the Olympics on ice In the mid 1990s roller hockey played with a ball rather than a puck became so popular that it even made an appearance in the Olympics in 1992 The National Sporting Goods Association statistics showed from a 1999 study that 2.5 million people played roller hockey Roller skating was considered for the 2012 Summer Olympics but has never become an Olympic event Other roller skating sports include jam skating and roller derby Roller skating popularity exploded during the disco era but tapered off in the 1980s and 1990s Sales of roller skates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought safe outdoor activities.Roller skating saw a revival in the late 2010s and early 2020s spurred on by a number of viral videos on the popular video sharing app TikTok Many popular brands sold out to the point of back-order with many people taking up the hobby during COVID-19 quarantines across
/m/06m11,Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states from the most sublime virtue or good habit the deepest interpersonal affection to the simplest pleasure An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse which differs from the love for food Most commonly love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative with its virtue representing human kindness compassion and affection as `` the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another '' and its vice representing human moral flaw akin to vanity selfishness amour-propre and egotism as potentially leading people into a type of mania obsessiveness or codependency It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans one 's self or animals In its various forms love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and owing to its central psychological importance is one of the most common themes in the creative arts Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love essentially familial love ( in Greek Storge ) friendly love or platonic love ( Philia ) romantic love ( Eros ) self-love ( Philautia ) guest love ( Xenia ) and divine love ( Agape ) Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love unrequited love empty love companionate love consummate love infatuated love self-love and courtly love Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren Yuanfen Mamihlapinatapai Cafuné Kama Bhakti Mettā Ishq Chesed Amore Charity Saudade ( and other variants or symbioses of these states ) as culturally unique words definitions or expressions of love in regards to a specified `` moments '' currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades The color wheel theory of love defines three primary three secondary and nine tertiary love styles describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel The triangular theory of love suggests `` intimacy passion and commitment '' are core components of love Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define compared to other emotional states == Definitions == The word `` love '' can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts Many other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as `` love '' one example is the plurality of Greek concepts for `` love '' ( agape eros philia storge ) Cultural differences in conceptualizing love thus doubly impede the establishment of a universal definition.Although the nature or essence of love is a subject of frequent debate different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what is n't love ( antonyms of `` love '' ) Love as a general expression of positive

/m/0dkzw,A seat belt ( also known as a safety belt or spelled seatbelt ) is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the driver or a passenger of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden stop A seat belt reduces the likelihood of death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag ( if equipped ) and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over When in motion the driver and passengers are traveling at the same speed as the vehicle If the vehicle suddenly stops or crashes the occupants continue at the same speed the vehicle was going before it stopped A seatbelt applies an opposing force to the driver and passengers to prevent them from falling out or making contact with the interior of the car ( especially preventing contact with or going through the windshield ) Seatbelts are considered primary restraint systems ( PRSs ) because of their vital role in occupant safety == Effectiveness == An analysis conducted in the United States in 1984 compared a variety of seat belt types alone and in combination with air bags The range of fatality reduction for front seat passengers was broad from 20 % to 55 % as was the range of major injury from 25 % to 60 % More recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has summarized these data by stating `` seat belts reduce serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about half '' Most seatbelt malfunctions are a result of there being too much slack in the seatbelt at the time of the accident.It has been suggested that although seat belt usage reduces the probability of death in any given accident mandatory seat belt laws have little or no effect on the overall number of traffic fatalities because seat belt usage also disincentivizes safe driving behaviors thereby increasing the total number of accidents This idea known as compensating-behavior theory is not supported by the evidence.In case of vehicle rollover in a US passenger car or SUV from 1994 to 2004 wearing seat belt reduced the risk of fatalities or incapacitating injuries and increased the probability of no injury In case of vehicle rollover in a US passenger car there are 0.71 % fatalities in 1994 and 0.87 % in 2014 when user is restrained There are 7 % fatalities in 1994 and 13 % in 2014 when user is unrestrained In case of vehicle rollover there are 10 % incapacitating injury in 1994 and 10 % in 2014 when user is restrained There are 32 % incapacitating injury in 1994 and 25 % in 2014 when user is unrestrained The probability of no injury is 45 % in 1994 and 44 % in 2014 when user is restrained There are 19 % no injury in 1994 and 15 % in 2014 when user is unrestrained == History ==

/m/06_fw,Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard as well as a recreational activity an art form an entertainment industry job and a method of transportation Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $ 4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world In 2016 it was announced that skateboarding would be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo for both male and female teams.Since the 1970s skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders freestyle BMXers aggressive skaters and more recently scooters However skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity although illegal has damaged curbs stoneworks steps benches plazas and parks == History == === 1940s–1960s === The first skateboards started with wooden boxes or boards with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom Crate scooters preceded skateboards having a wooden crate attached to the nose ( front of the board ) which formed rudimentary handlebars The boxes turned into planks similar to the skateboard decks of today.Skateboarding as it exists today was probably born sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat This was called `` sidewalk surfing '' – a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular No one knows who made the first board it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles California surf shop meant to be used by surfers in their downtime The shop owner Bill Richard made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels which they attached to square wooden boards Accordingly skateboarding was originally denoted `` sidewalk surfing '' and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers and performed barefoot.By the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack 's Kips Hobie Bing 's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards and assembled teams to promote their products One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha 's founder Larry Stevenson in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach California Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called Surf 's Up in 1964 hosted by Stan Richards that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.As the popularity of skateboarding began expanding the first skateboarding magazine The Quarterly Skateboarder was published in 1964 John Severson who published the magazine wrote in his first editorial Today 's skateboarders are founders in this sport—they 're pioneers—they are the first There is no history in Skateboarding—its being made now—by you The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the

/m/0h8kx63,The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve superior spaceflight capability It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II The technological advantage demonstrated by spaceflight achievement was seen as necessary for national security and became part of the symbolism and ideology of the time The Space Race brought pioneering launches of artificial satellites robotic space probes to the Moon Venus and Mars and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.Public interest in space travel originated in the 1951 publication of a Soviet youth magazine and was promptly picked up by US magazines The competition began on July 30 1955 when the United States announced its intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year Four days later the Soviet Union responded by declaring they would also launch a satellite `` in the near future '' The launching of satellites was enabled by developments in ballistic missile capabilities since the end of World War II The competition gained Western public attention with the `` Sputnik crisis '' when the USSR achieved the first successful satellite launch Sputnik 1 on October 4 1957 It gained momentum when the USSR sent the first human Yuri Gagarin into space with the orbital flight of Vostok 1 on April 12 1961 These were followed by a string of other early firsts achieved by the Soviets over the next few years.Gagarin 's flight led US president John F. Kennedy to raise the stakes on May 25 1961 by asking the US Congress to commit to the goal of `` landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth '' before the end of the decade Both countries began developing super heavy-lift launch vehicles with the US successfully deploying the Saturn V which was large enough to send a three-person orbiter and two-person lander to the Moon Kennedy 's Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969 with the flight of Apollo 11 a singular achievement Americans believed overshadowed all Soviet achievements However such an opinion is generally contentious with others attributing the first man in space as being a much larger achievement The USSR pursued two crewed lunar programs but did not succeed with their N1 rocket to launch and land on the Moon before the US and eventually canceled it to concentrate on Salyut the first space station programme and the first time landings on Venus and on Mars Meanwhile the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon and continued exploration of other extraterrestrial bodies robotically A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project ( ASTP ) resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS-75 Being considered as the final act of the Space Race the competition would only gradually be replaced with cooperation

/m/01s55n,A suitcase is a form of luggage It is a rectangular container with a handle typically used to carry one 's clothes and other belongings while traveling The first suitcases appeared in the late 19th century due to the increased popularity of mass tourism at the time and were meant to hold dress suits They were originally made using heavier materials such as leather or steel but beginning in the 1930s were generally constructed with more lightweight materials like plastic and cardboard Before the 1970s the idea of rolling luggage was shunned by the travel industry who viewed it as much less masculine than traditional luggage Entrepreneur Bernard D. Sadow pitched his version of the wheeled suitcase for which he was granted a patent in 1972 to various department stores before it was picked up and sold at Macy 's stores starting in 1970 It took several years to become the predominant form of suitcase and Sadow 's version was soon superseded by the Rollaboard a type of wheeled suitcase that was upright rather than flat like Sadow 's model and invented in 1987 by pilot Robert Plath The addition of wheels to the suitcase has since been called one of the most significant innovations in travel Smart suitcases with enhanced capabilities such as GPS tracking and device charging were popularized in the 2010s though explosions of their lithium ion batteries in cargo holds caused them to be banned from being checked by many major airlines in the late 2010s == History == === 12th century to late 19th century Luggage before the suitcase === During the Crusades the first luggage—wheeled containers used to transport weaponry—was developed in 1153 The word `` luggage '' derived from the verb `` lug '' was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 1596 to mean `` denoting inconveniently heavy baggage '' Luggage prior to the invention of the suitcase was mostly wood and leather trunks with an iron base which were waterproofed using canvas or tree sap Servants were often made to carry these trunks for their owners such as for European elites during the Grand Tour in the 18th century since travel was mostly exclusive to the wealthy === Late 19th century to mid-20th century Beginnings === As mass tourism increased in popularity and travel became accessible to non-elites due to railways and cruise ships the need for more practical luggage increased In the late 19th century the first luggage known as `` suit cases '' or `` suit-cases '' which were meant to carry dress suits without wrinkling them came about The earliest models of suitcases were invented by British businessmen who used them to carry goods and clothing They were modeled after trunks and made by stretching leather rubbery cloth or wicker over a flat rigid frame made of wood or steel with leather or brass caps on the corners and a handle on their long side contrasting them with trunks which had handles on their two shorter sides They typically had a compartment for shirts and a hat box on the

/m/04brg2,Tableware is any dish or dishware used for setting a table serving food and dining It includes cutlery glassware serving dishes and other items for practical as well as decorative purposes The quality nature variety and number of objects varies according to culture religion number of diners cuisine and occasion For example Middle Eastern Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes using bread or leaves as individual plates Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.Cutlery is more usually known as silverware or flatware in the United States where cutlery usually means knives and related cutting instruments elsewhere cutlery includes all the forks spoons and other silverware items Outside the US flatware is a term for `` open-shaped '' dishware items such as plates dishes and bowls ( as opposed to `` closed '' shapes like jugs and vases ) Dinnerware is another term used to refer to tableware and crockery refers to ceramic tableware today often porcelain or bone china Sets of dishes are referred to as a table service dinner service or service set Table settings or place settings are the dishes cutlery and glassware used for formal and informal dining In Ireland such items are normally referred to as delph the word being an English language phonetic spelling of the word Delft the town from which so much delftware came Silver service or butler service are methods for a butler or waiter to serve a meal Setting the table refers to arranging the tableware including individual place settings for each diner at the table as well as decorating the table itself in a manner suitable for the occasion Tableware and table decoration are typically more elaborate for special occasions Unusual dining locations demand tableware be adapted == Materials == In recent centuries flatware is usually made of pottery ceramic materials such as earthenware stoneware bone china or porcelain The triumph of ceramics is probably due to the spread of ceramic glazes which were slow to develop in Europe without the glassy surface they give pottery tableware may be less hygienic Tableware can be made of other materials such as wood pewter latten silver gold glass acrylic and plastic Before it was possible to purchase mass-produced tableware it was fashioned from available materials such as wood Industrialisation and developments in ceramic manufacture made inexpensive washable tableware available It is sold either by the piece or as a matched set for a number of diners normally four six eight or twelve place settings Large quantities are purchased for use in restaurants Individual pieces such as those needed as replacement pieces for broken dishes can be procured from `` open stock '' inventory at shops or from antique dealers if the pattern is no longer in production Cutlery is normally made of metal of some kind though large pieces such as ladles for serving may be of wood == History == === Plates and other vessels === The earliest pottery in cultures around the world does not seem to have included flatware concentrating on pots
/m/07crc,In biology a taxon ( back-formation from taxonomy plural taxa ) is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit Although neither is required a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established It is very common however for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion If a taxon is given a formal scientific name its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping Initial attempts at classifying and ordering organisms ( plants and animals ) were set forth in Carl Linnaeus 's system in Systema Naturae 10th edition ( 1758 ) as well as an unpublished work by Bernard and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu The idea of a unit-based system of biological classification was first made widely available in 1805 in the introduction of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck 's Flore françoise and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle 's Principes élémentaires de botanique Lamarck set out a system for the `` natural classification '' of plants Since then systematists continue to construct accurate classifications encompassing the diversity of life today a `` good '' or `` useful '' taxon is commonly taken to be one that reflects evolutionary relationships.Many modern systematists such as advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature use cladistic methods that require taxa to be monophyletic ( all descendants of some ancestor ) Their basic unit therefore the clade is equivalent to the taxon assuming that taxa should reflect evolutionary relationships Similarly among those contemporary taxonomists working with the traditional Linnean ( binomial ) nomenclature few propose taxa they know to be paraphyletic An example of a long-established taxon that is not also a clade is the class Reptilia the reptiles birds and mammals are the descendants of animals traditionally classed as reptiles but neither are included in the Reptilia ( birds are traditionally placed in the class Aves and mammals in the class Mammalia ) == History == The term taxon was first used in 1926 by Adolf Meyer-Abich for animal groups as a back-formation from the word taxonomy the word taxonomy had been coined a century before from the Greek components τάξις ( taxis meaning arrangement ) and -νομία ( -nomia meaning method ) For plants it was proposed by Herman Johannes Lam in 1948 and it was adopted at the VII International Botanical Congress held in 1950 == Definition == The glossary of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( 1999 ) defines a '' taxon ( pl taxa ) n.A taxonomic unit whether named or not i.e a population or group of populations of organisms which are usually inferred to be phylogenetically related and which have characters in common which differentiate ( q.v ) the unit ( e.g a geographic population a genus a family an order ) from other such units A taxon encompasses all included taxa of lower rank ( q.v
/m/0pg52,A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer ( an individual or legal entity ) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures ( regional local or national ) and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC A failure to pay in a timely manner ( non-compliance ) along with evasion of or resistance to taxation is punishable by law Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent Most countries have a tax system in place in order to pay for public common societal or agreed national needs and for the functions of government Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts Most countries charge a tax on an individual 's income as well as on corporate income Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes inheritance taxes estate taxes gift taxes property taxes sales taxes use taxes payroll taxes duties and/or tariffs In economic terms taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased ( known as fiscal multiplier ) or decreased ( known as excess burden of taxation ) Consequently taxation is a highly debated topic by some although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety classifying it as theft or extortion through coercion and the use of force == Overview == The legal definition and the economic definition of taxes differ in some ways such that economists do not regard many transfers to governments as taxes For example some transfers to the public sector are comparable to prices Examples include tuition at public universities and fees for utilities provided by local governments Governments also obtain resources by `` creating '' money and coins ( for example by printing bills and by minting coins ) through voluntary gifts ( for example contributions to public universities and museums ) by imposing penalties ( such as traffic fines ) by borrowing and confiscating criminal proceeds From the view of economists a tax is a non-penal yet compulsory transfer of resources from the private to the public sector levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefits received In modern taxation systems governments levy taxes in money but in-kind and corvée taxation are characteristic of traditional or pre-capitalist states and their functional equivalents The method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated in politics and economics Tax collection is performed
/m/01fh4r,A teapot is a vessel used for steeping tea leaves or a herbal mix in boiling or near-boiling water and for serving the resulting infusion which is called tea It is one of the core components of teaware Dry tea is available either in tea bags or as loose tea in which case a tea infuser or tea strainer may be of some assistance either to hold the leaves as they steep or to catch the leaves inside the teapot when the tea is poured Teapots usually have an opening with a lid at their top where the dry tea and hot water are added a handle for holding by hand and a spout through which the tea is served Some teapots have a strainer built-in on the inner edge of the spout A small air hole in the lid is often created to stop the spout from dripping and splashing when tea is poured In modern times a thermally insulating cover called a tea cosy may be used to enhance the steeping process or to prevent the contents of the teapot from cooling too rapidly == History == === China === The switch to specialized vessel for tea brewing was powered by the change from the powdered tea to leaf tea and from whipping to steeping that occurred in China It is hard to exactly pinpoint the time of the invention of a teapot since vessels in the shapes similar to the modern teapot were known in China since Neolithic period but were initially used for water and wine as boiling or whipping tea did not require a specialized container When tea preparation switched to infusion ( during the late Yuan Dynasty ) at first an ewer-like vessel were used for this purpose Tea preparation during previous dynasties did not use a teapot In the Tang Dynasty a cauldron was used to boil ground tea which was served in bowls Song Dynasty tea was made by boiling water in a kettle then pouring the water into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves A brush was then used to stir the tea Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text Jiyuan Conghua which describes a teapot that the author Cai Shizhan bought from the scholar Sun Daoming By the Ming Dynasty teapots were widespread in China There are early examples of teapots like the ones made in Jun ware and the eight-lobed celadon pots of the Song-Yuan times but an expert on Yixing ware Kuei-Hsiang Lo believes that the first teapots made especially for tea appeared around 1500 as copies of much earlier Yixing wine pots The earliest example of such teapot that has survived to this day seems to be the one in the Flagstaff House Museum of Teaware it has been dated to 1513 and is attributed to Gong Chun the `` father of Yixing teapot '' .Early teapots like those still used in modern Gongfu tea ceremony are small by western standards meant for the individual consumption of tea They use a higher ratio of
/m/07cx4,A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly A telephone converts sound typically and most efficiently the human voice into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user The term is derived from Greek τῆλε ( tēle far ) and φωνή ( phōnē voice ) together meaning distant voice A common short form of the term is phone which came into use early in the telephone 's history.In 1876 Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device This instrument was further developed by many others and became rapidly indispensable in business government and in households The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone ( transmitter ) to speak into and an earphone ( receiver ) which reproduces the voice at a distant location The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telecommunication system to the receiving telephone which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker Telephones permit transmission in both directions simultaneously Most telephones also contain an alerting feature such as a ringer or a visual indicator to announce an incoming telephone call Telephone calls are initiated most commonly with a keypad or dial affixed to the telephone to enter a telephone number which is the address of the call recipient 's telephone in the telecommunication system but other methods existed in the early history of the telephone The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer 's office or residence to another customer 's location Being impractical beyond just a few customers these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards These exchanges were soon connected together eventually forming an automated worldwide public switched telephone network For greater mobility various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973 In later decades their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost Convergence in communication services has provided a broad spectrum of capabilities in cell phones including mobile computing giving rise to the smartphone the dominant type of telephone in the world today == Early history == Before the development of the electric telephone the term telephone was applied to other inventions and not all early researchers of the electrical device used the term Perhaps the earliest use of the word for a communications system was the telephon created by Gottfried Huth in 1796 Huth proposed an alternative to the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe in which the operators in the signaling towers would shout
/m/07c52,Television sometimes shortened to TV is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound The term can refer to a television set or the medium of television transmission Television is a mass medium for advertising entertainment news and sports Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers After World War II an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States and television sets became commonplace in homes businesses and institutions During the 1950s television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion In the mid-1960s color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes LaserDiscs high-capacity hard disk drives CDs DVDs flash drives high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule For many reasons especially the convenience of remote retrieval the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud ( such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix ) At the end of the first decade of the 2000s digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity Another development was the move from standard-definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high-definition television ( HDTV ) which provides a resolution that is substantially higher HDTV may be transmitted in different formats 1080p 1080i and 720p Since 2010 with the invention of smart television Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix Amazon Prime Video iPlayer and Hulu In 2013 79 % of the world 's households owned a television set The replacement of earlier cathode-ray tube ( CRT ) screen displays with compact energy-efficient flat-panel alternative technologies such as LCDs ( both fluorescent-backlit and LED ) OLED displays and plasma displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s Most television sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel mainly LEDs Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT Digital Light Processing ( DLP ) plasma and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s In the near future LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs Also major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TVs in the mid-2010s Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency television transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber satellite systems and since the 2000s via the Internet Until the early 2000s these were transmitted as analog signals but a transition to digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s A standard television set consists
/m/0h8my_4,A racket or racquet is a sports implement used for striking a ball or shuttlecock in games such as squash tennis racquetball badminton and padel In the strictest sense a racket consists of a handled frame with an open hoop across which a network of strings is stretched tightly Some rackets may have a solid or perforated hitting surface instead of a network of strings Such rackets may be called a paddle or bat Collectively these games are known as racket sports Racket design materials and manufacturing has changed considerably over the centuries The frame of rackets for all sports was traditionally made of solid wood ( later laminated wood ) and the strings of animal intestine known as catgut The traditional racket size was limited by the strength and weight of the wooden frame which had to be strong enough to hold the strings and stiff enough to hit the ball or shuttle Manufacturers started adding non-wood laminates to wood rackets to improve stiffness Non-wood rackets were made first of steel then of aluminum and then carbon fiber composites Wood is still used for real tennis rackets and xare Most rackets are now made of composite materials including carbon fiber or fiberglass metals such as titanium alloys or ceramics Catgut has partially been replaced by synthetic materials including nylon polyamide and other polymers Rackets are restrung when necessary which may be after every match for a professional Despite the name `` catgut '' has never been made from any part of a cat == Spelling == Racket is the standard American spelling of the word Racquet is an alternative spelling more common in Britain as evidenced by the BBC style guide Racquet is used more commonly in certain sports such as tennis squash racquetball and badminton and less commonly in others However the International Tennis Federation uses racket which is the original spelling dating from the 16th century Racquet appeared in the 19th century as a French-influenced variant of racket == Etymology == The origin of the term `` racket '' is unclear It may be derived from the Flemish word `` raketsen '' which is itself derived from Middle French `` rachasser '' meaning `` to strike ( the ball ) back '' == Badminton == Badminton rackets are light with top quality rackets weighing between about 70 and 95 grams Modern rackets are composed of carbon fiber composite ( graphite reinforced plastic ) which may be augmented by a variety of materials Carbon fiber has an excellent strength to weight ratio is stiff and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer Before the adoption of carbon fiber composite rackets were made of wood to their excessive weight and cost There is a wide variety of racket designs although the badminton racket size and shape are limited by the laws of the game Different rackets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players The traditional oval head shape is still available but an isometric head shape is increasingly common in new rackets Various companies have emerged but Yonex of Japan and Victor
/m/01rkbr,Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present into the future It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion philosophy and science but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars Nevertheless diverse fields such as business industry sports the sciences and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as `` what a clock reads '' .The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime Examples of events are the collision of two particles the explosion of a supernova or the arrival of a rocket ship Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position ( the event 's coordinates ) However the numerical values are different for different observers In general relativity the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds At this time there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units ( SI ) and International System of Quantities The SI base unit of time is the second which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms Time is used to define other quantities such as velocity so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition An operational definition of time wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event ( such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum ) constitutes one standard unit such as the second is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life To describe observations of an event a location ( position in space ) and time are typically noted The operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of time is It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime it has been shown that time can be distorted
/m/07dm6,"The tiger ( Panthera tigris ) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside An apex predator it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent leaving their mother 's home range to establish their own The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands Since the early 20th century tiger populations have lost at least 93 % of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia the islands of Java and Bali and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent Indochina and a single Indonesian island Sumatra The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List As of 2015 the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals with most populations living in small isolated pockets India currently hosts the largest tiger population Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction habitat fragmentation and poaching Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict due to encroachment in countries with a high human population density The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world 's charismatic megafauna It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature appearing on many flags coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams The tiger is the national animal of India Bangladesh Malaysia and South Korea == Etymology == The Middle English tigre and Old English tigras derive from Old French tigre from Latin tigris This was a borrowing of Classical Greek τίγρις 'tigris a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger and the river Tigris The origin may have been the Persian word tigra ( 'pointed or sharp ) and the Avestan word tigrhi ( 'arrow ) perhaps referring to the speed of the tiger 's leap although these words are not known to have any meanings associated with tigers.The generic name Panthera is derived from the Latin word panthera and the Ancient Greek word πάνθηρ ( 'panther ) == Taxonomy == In 1758 Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris In 1929 the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris === Subspecies"

/m/012xff,A toothbrush is an oral hygiene tool used to clean the teeth gums and tongue It consists of a head of tightly clustered bristles atop of which toothpaste can be applied mounted on a handle which facilitates the cleaning of hard-to-reach areas of the mouth They should be used in conjunction with something to clean between the teeth where the bristles of the toothbrush can not reach for example floss tape or interdental brushes They are available with different bristle textures sizes and forms Most dentists recommend using a soft toothbrush since hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate the gums.Because many common and effective ingredients in toothpaste are harmful if swallowed in large doses and instead should be spat out the act of brushing teeth is most often done at a sink within the kitchen or bathroom where the brush may be rinsed off afterwards to remove any debris remaining and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for germ growth ( and if it is a wooden toothbrush mold as well ) Some toothbrushes have plant-based handles often bamboo However numerous others are made of cheap plastic such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution Over 1 billion toothbrushes are disposed of into landfills annually in the United States alone Bristles are commonly made of nylon ( which while not biodegradable as plastic is may still be recycled ) or bamboo viscose == History == === Precursors === Before the invention of the toothbrush a variety of oral hygiene measures had been used This has been verified by excavations during which tree twigs bird feathers animal bones and porcupine quills were recovered The predecessor of the toothbrush is the chew stick Chew sticks were twigs with frayed ends used to brush the teeth while the other end was used as a toothpick The earliest chew sticks were discovered in Sumer in southern Mesopotamia in 3500 BC an Egyptian tomb dating from 3000 BC and mentioned in Chinese records dating from 1600 BC The Indian way of using tooth wood for brushing is presented by the Chinese Monk Yijing ( 635–713 CE ) when he describes the rules for Monks in his book '' Every day in the morning a monk must chew a piece of tooth wood to brush his teeth and scrape his tongue and this must be done in the proper way Only after one has washed one ’ s hands and mouth may one make salutations Otherwise both the saluter and the saluted are at fault In Sanskrit the tooth wood is known as the dantakastha—danta meaning tooth and kastha a piece of wood It is twelve finger-widths in length The shortest is not less than eight finger-widths long resembling the little finger in size Chew one end of the wood well for a long while and then brush the teeth with it '' The Greeks and Romans used toothpicks to clean their teeth and toothpick-like twigs have been excavated in Qin Dynasty tombs Chew sticks remain common in Africa the rural Southern United States and in
/m/07dd4,In physiology the somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch ( haptic perception ) as well as temperature ( thermoception ) body position ( proprioception ) and pain It is a subset of the sensory nervous system which also represents visual auditory olfactory and gustatory stimuli Somatosensation begins when mechano- and thermosensitive structures in the skin or internal organs sense physical stimuli such as pressure on the skin ( see mechanotransduction nociception ) Activation of these structures or receptors leads to activation of peripheral sensory neurons that convey signals to the spinal cord as patterns of action potentials Sensory information is then processed locally in the spinal cord to drive reflexes and is also conveyed to the brain for conscious perception of touch and proprioception Note somatosensory information from the face and head enters the brain through peripheral sensory neurons in the cranial nerves such as the trigeminal nerve The neural pathways that go to the brain are structured such that information about the location of the physical stimulus is preserved In this way neighboring neurons in the somatosensory cerebral cortex in the brain represent nearby locations on the skin or in the body creating a map also called a cortical homunculus == System overview == === Sensory receptors === The four mechanoreceptors in the skin each respond to different stimuli for short or long periods Merkel cell nerve endings are found in the basal epidermis and hair follicles they react to low vibrations ( 5–15 Hz ) and deep static touch such as shapes and edges Due to having a small receptive field ( extremely detailed information ) they are used in areas like fingertips the most they are not covered ( shelled ) and thus respond to pressures over long periods Tactile corpuscles react to moderate vibration ( 10–50 Hz ) and light touch They are located in the dermal papillae due to their reactivity they are primarily located in fingertips and lips They respond in quick action potentials unlike Merkel nerve endings They are responsible for the ability to read Braille and feel gentle stimuli Pacinian corpuscles determine gross touch and distinguish rough and soft substances They react in quick action potentials especially to vibrations around 250 Hz ( even up to centimeters away ) They are the most sensitive to vibrations and have large receptor fields Pacinian corpuscles react only to sudden stimuli so pressures like clothes that are always compressing their shape are quickly ignored They have also been implicated in detecting the location of touch sensations on handheld tools.Bulbous corpuscles react slowly and respond to sustained skin stretch They are responsible for the feeling of object slippage and play a major role in the kinesthetic sense and control of finger position and movement Merkel and bulbous cells slow-response are myelinated the rest fast-response are not All of these receptors are activated upon pressures that squish their shape causing an action potential === Somatosensory cortex === The postcentral gyrus includes the primary somatosensory cortex (
/m/011k07,Tortoises ( ) are reptiles of the family Testudinidae of the order Testudines ( Latin tortoise ) Like other turtles tortoises have a shell to protect from predation and other threats The shell in tortoises is generally hard and like other members of the suborder Cryptodira they retract their necks and heads directly backward into the shell to protect them Tortoises can vary in size with some species such as the Galápagos giant tortoise growing to more than 1.2 metres ( 3.9 ft ) in length whereas others like the Speckled cape tortoise have shells that measure only 6.8 centimetres ( 2.7 in ) long Several lineages of tortoises have independently evolved very large body sizes in excess of 100 kg including the Galapagos giant tortoise and the Aldabra giant tortoise They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures They are generally reclusive animals Tortoises are the longest-living land animals in the world although the longest-living species of tortoise is a matter of debate Galápagos tortoises are noted to live over 150 years but an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita may have lived an estimated 255 years In general most tortoise species can live 80–150 years Tortoises are placid and slow-moving with an average walking speed of 0.2–0.5 km/h == Terminology == Differences exist in usage of the common terms turtle tortoise and terrapin depending on the variety of English being used usage is inconsistent and contradictory These terms are common names and do not reflect precise biological or taxonomic distinctions The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses `` turtle '' to describe all species of the order Testudines regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling and uses `` tortoise '' as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species General American usage agrees turtle is often a general term ( although some restrict it to aquatic turtles ) tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or more narrowly only those members of Testudinidae the family of modern land tortoises and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water in particular the diamondback terrapin ( Malaclemys terrapin ) In America for example the members of the genus Terrapene dwell on land yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises.British usage by contrast tends not to use `` turtle '' as a generic term for all members of the order and also applies the term `` tortoises '' broadly to all land-dwelling members of the order Testudines regardless of whether they are actually members of the family Testudinidae In Britain terrapin is used to refer to a larger group of semiaquatic turtles than the restricted meaning in America.Australian usage is different from both American and British usage Land tortoises are not native to Australia and traditionally freshwater turtles have been called `` tortoises '' in Australia Some Australian experts disapprove of this usage—believing that the term tortoises is `` better confined to purely terrestrial animals with very different habits and needs none of
/m/0162_1,A tower is a tall structure taller than it is wide often by a significant factor Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore along with tall buildings self-supporting structures Towers are specifically distinguished from buildings in that they are built not to be habitable but to serve other functions using the height of the tower For example the height of a clock tower improves the visibility of the clock and the height of a tower in a fortified building such as a castle increases the visibility of the surroundings for defensive purposes Towers may also be built for observation leisure or telecommunication purposes A tower can stand alone or be supported by adjacent buildings or it may be a feature on top of a larger structure or building == Etymology == Old English torr is from Latin turris via Old French tor The Latin term together with Greek τύρσις was loaned from a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean language connected with the Illyrian toponym Βου-δοργίς With the Lydian toponyms Τύρρα Τύρσα it has been connected with the ethnonym Τυρρήνιοι as well as with Tusci ( from * Turs-ci ) the Greek and Latin names for the Etruscans ( Kretschmer Glotta 22 110ff ) == History == Towers have been used by mankind since prehistoric times The oldest known may be the circular stone tower in walls of Neolithic Jericho ( 8000 BC ) Some of the earliest towers were ziggurats which existed in Sumerian architecture since the 4th millennium BC The most famous ziggurats include the Sumerian Ziggurat of Ur built in the 3rd millennium BC and the Etemenanki one of the most famous examples of Babylonian architecture Some of the earliest surviving examples are the broch structures in northern Scotland which are conical tower houses These and other examples from Phoenician and Roman cultures emphasised the use of a tower in fortification and sentinel roles For example the name of the Moroccan city of Mogador founded in the first millennium BC is derived from the Phoenician word for watchtower ( 'migdol ) The Romans utilised octagonal towers as elements of Diocletian 's Palace in Croatia which monument dates to approximately 300 AD while the Servian Walls ( 4th century BC ) and the Aurelian Walls ( 3rd century AD ) featured square ones The Chinese used towers as integrated elements of the Great Wall of China in 210 BC during the Qin Dynasty Towers were also an important element of castles Other well known towers include the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa Italy built from 1173 until 1372 the Two Towers in Bologna Italy built from 1109 until 1119 and the Towers of Pavia ( 25 survive ) built between 11th and 13th century The Himalayan Towers are stone towers located chiefly in Tibet built approximately 14th to 15th century == Mechanics == Up to a certain height a tower can be made with the supporting structure with parallel sides However above a certain height the compressive load of the material is exceeded and the tower will
/m/01fdzj,A town is a human settlement Towns are generally larger than villages and smaller than cities though the criteria to distinguish between them vary considerably in different parts of the world == Origin and use == The word `` town '' shares an origin with the German word Zaun the Dutch word tuin and the Old Norse tún The original Proto-Germanic word * tūnan is thought to be an early borrowing from Proto-Celtic * dūnom ( cf Old Irish dún Welsh din ) .The original sense of the word in both Germanic and Celtic was that of a fortress or an enclosure Cognates of town in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge In English and Dutch the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed and through which a track must run In England a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications and built a palisade or stockade instead In the Netherlands this space was a garden more specifically those of the wealthy which had a high fence or a wall around them ( like the garden of the palace of Het Loo in Apeldoorn which was the model for the privy garden of William III and Mary II at Hampton Court ) In Old Norse tún means a ( grassy ) place between farmhouses and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian Old English tūn became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period In Old English and Early and Middle Scots the words ton toun etc could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings partly picking up the Norse sense ( as in the Scots word fermtoun ) at one end of the scale to fortified municipalities Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included ham 'home stede 'stead and burh 'bury borough burgh In some cases town is an alternative name for `` city '' or `` village '' ( especially a larger village ) Sometimes the word town is short for township In general today towns can be differentiated from townships villages or hamlets on the basis of their economic character in that most of a town 's population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing industry commerce and public services rather than primary sector industries such as agriculture or related activities A place 's population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character In many areas of the world e.g in India at least until recent times a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town In the United Kingdom there are historical cities that are far smaller than the larger towns The modern phenomenon of extensive suburban growth satellite urban development and migration of city dwellers to villages has further complicated the definition of towns creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities Some forms

S. Lewis saw a clear distinction between joy pleasure and happiness `` I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy '' and `` I call it Joy which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure Joy ( in my sense ) has indeed one characteristic and one only in common with them the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again ... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever if both were in his power exchange it for all the pleasures in the world But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is `` Michela Summa says that the distinction between joy and happiness is that `` Joy accompanies the process through and through whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process ... joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life-concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one ’ s life or one ’ s own life as a whole '' == Causes == The causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources `` When the mind is pure joy follows like a shadow that never leaves. ” Gautama Buddha '' [ Joy is ] the emotional dimension of the good life of a life that is both going well and is being lived well '' Miroslav Volf '' This is the true joy in life the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy '' George Bernard ShawArianna Huffington an advocate for the things that instigate joy studied ways that joy can be triggered In her research she determined that joy is produced by positive responses that certain neurochemicals in the brain produce during stimulating activities such as dopamine According to Huffington activities that are able to evoke a positive neurochemical response are producers of joy Ingrid Fetell Lee has studied the sources of joy She wrote the book `` Joyful The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness '' and gave a TED talk on the subject titled `` Where joy hides and how to find it '' == See also == Joie de vivre Happiness Reward system Pleasure == References ==
/m/015qff,"Traffic lights traffic signals or stoplights – known also as robots in South Africa are signalling devices positioned at road intersections pedestrian crossings and other locations in order to control flows of traffic.Traffic lights consist normally of three signals transmitting meaningful information to drivers and riders through colours and symbols including arrows and bicycles The regular traffic light colours are red amber ( also known as yellow ) and green arranged vertically or horizontally in that order Although this is internationally standardised variations exist on national and local scales as to traffic light sequences and laws.The method was first introduced in December 1868 on Parliament Square in London to reduce the need for police officers to control traffic Since then electricity and computerised control has advanced traffic light technology and increased intersection capacity The system is also used for other purposes for example to control pedestrian movements variable lane control ( such as tidal flow systems or smart motorways ) and railway level crossings == History == The first system of traffic signals was installed as a way to replace police officer control of vehicular traffic outside the Houses of Parliament in London on 9 December 1868 In the first two decades of the 20th century semaphore traffic signals like the one in London were in use all over the United States with each state having its own design of the device In many cases it was controlled by a traffic officer who would blow a whistle before changing the commands on this signal to help alert travellers of the change.In 1912 the first electric traffic light was developed by Lester Wire a policeman in Salt Lake City Utah It was installed by the American Traffic Signal Company on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland Ohio The first four-way three-colour traffic light was created by police officer William Potts in Detroit Michigan in 1920 He was concerned about how police officers at four different light signals could not change their lights all at the same time The answer was a third light that was coloured amber which was the same colour used on the railroad In 1922 traffic towers were beginning to be controlled by automatic timers The main advantage of the use of the timer was that it saved cities money by replacing traffic officers The city of New York was able to reassign all but 500 of its 6,000 officers working on the traffic squad this saved the city $ 12,500,000.The control of traffic lights made a big turn with the rise of computers in America in the 1950s One of the best historical examples of computerized control of lights was in Denver in 1952 In 1967 the city of Toronto was the first to use more advanced computers that were better at vehicle detection The computers maintained control over 159 signals in the cities through telephone lines == Vehicular signals == A set of lights known as a signal head 3.2.4 may have one two three or more aspects The most common signal type"
/m/01mqdt,"Traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones Later signs with directional arms were introduced for example the fingerposts in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in Saxony With traffic volumes increasing since the 1930s many countries have adopted pictorial signs or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to overcome language barriers and enhance traffic safety Such pictorial signs use symbols ( often silhouettes ) in place of words and are usually based on international protocols Such signs were first developed in Europe and have been adopted by most countries to varying degrees == International conventions == International conventions such as Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals have helped to achieve a degree of uniformity in Traffic signing in various countries Countries have also unilaterally ( to some extent ) followed other countries in order to avoid confusion == Categories == Traffic signs can be grouped into several types For example Annexe 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals ( 1968 ) which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries defines eight categories of signs A Danger warning signs B Priority signs C.

'' It is directly derived from the Dutch wafel which itself derives from the Middle Dutch wafele.While the Middle Dutch wafele is first attested to at the end of the 13th century it is preceded by the French walfre in 1185 both from Frankish wafla 'honeycomb or 'cake'.Other spellings throughout modern and medieval Europe include waffe wafre wafer wâfel waufre iauffe gaufre goffre gauffre wafe waffel wåfe wāfel wafe vaffel and våffla == History == === Medieval origins === In ancient times the Greeks cooked flat cakes called obelios between hot metal plates As they were spread throughout medieval Europe the cake mix a mixture of flour water or milk and often eggs became known as wafers and were also cooked over an open fire between iron plates with long handles Waffles are preceded in the early Middle Ages around the period of the 9th–10th centuries with the simultaneous emergence of fer à hosties / hostieijzers ( communion wafer irons ) and moule à oublies ( wafer irons ) While the communion wafer irons typically depicted imagery of Jesus and his crucifixion the moule à oublies featured more trivial Biblical scenes or simple emblematic designs The format of the iron itself was almost always round and considerably larger than those used for communion.The oublie was in its basic form composed only of grain flour and water – just as was the communion wafer It took until the 11th century as a product of The Crusades bringing new culinary ingredients to Western Europe for flavorings such as orange blossom water to be added to the oublies however locally sourced honey and other flavorings may have already been in use before that time.Oublies not formally named as such until c. 1200 spread throughout northwestern continental Europe eventually leading to the formation of the oublieurs guild in 1270 These oublieurs/obloyers were responsible for not only producing the oublies but also for a number of other contemporaneous and subsequent pâtisseries légères ( light pastries ) including the waffles that were soon to arise === 14th–16th centuries === In the late 14th century the first known waffle recipe was penned in an anonymous manuscript Le Ménagier de Paris written by a husband as a set of instructions to his young wife While it technically contains four recipes all are a variation of the first Beat some eggs in a bowl season with salt and add wine Toss in some flour and mix Then fill little by little two irons at a time with
/m/04z4wx,A waffle iron or waffle maker is a utensil or appliance used to cook waffles It comprises two metal plates with a connecting hinge molded to create the honeycomb pattern found on waffles The iron is heated and either batter is poured or dough is placed between the plates which are then closed together to bake breakfast delicacies with a sweet dessert flavor very similar to pancakes but lighter and sweeter The appearance is much harder to achieve than a pancake hence the waffle iron == Varieties == Traditional waffle irons are attached to tongs with wooden handles and held over an open flame or set on a stove Most modern waffle irons are self-contained tabletop electrical appliances heated by an electric heating element controlled by an internal thermostat Electric irons come with either removable or non-removable plates Professional waffle makers are usually made of uncoated cast iron whereas domestic models particularly cast aluminum ones are often teflon coated Many have a light that goes off when the iron reaches a set temperature Modern versions offer multiple choices Some make a very thin waffle capable of making waffle cones or Pizzelle While there is no set standard for waffle shapes or thicknesses models that produce the most common shapes and thicknesses are often labeled as `` traditional '' or `` classic '' Models that make thicker and/or larger pocketed waffles are often labeled as `` Belgian '' In the US the most commonly used determinant of whether a waffle is a `` Belgian waffle '' or not is thickness and/or pocket size although the recipes for Belgian waffles and American waffles do differ == History == The earliest waffle irons originated in the Low Countries around the 14th century These were constructed of two hinged iron plates connected to two long wooden handles The plates were often made to imprint elaborate patterns on the waffle including coats of arms landscapes or religious symbols Waffles would be baked over the hearth fire In 1869 American Cornelius Swartwout patented the stove-top waffle iron While waffle irons of sorts may have existed since the 1400s Swarthout intended to perfect the design by adding a handle and a hinge that swivelled in a cast-iron collar allowing the waffle-maker to flip the iron without danger of slippage or burns.In 1891 John Kliembach a German immigrant living in Shamokin Pennsylvania became a traveling salesman of waffles after fashioning an iron for the Mansion House Hotel Kliembach sold waffles for a penny each or ten cents for a dozen This was popular at the Chicago World 's Fair In 1911 General Electric produced a prototype electric waffle iron and production began around 1918 Later as the waffle iron became more prevalent its appearance was improved == Nike shoe sole == In 1971 Oregon track coach and Nike Co-founder Bill Bowerman used his wife 's waffle iron to experiment on rubber to create a new sole for track shoes that would grip but be lightweight and increase the runner 's speed Oregon 's Hayward Field was transitioning to an artificial
/m/0h8mzrc,A clock or a timepiece is a device used to measure and indicate time The clock is one of the oldest human inventions meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units such as the day the lunar month and the year Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia Some predecessors to the modern clock may be considered as `` clocks '' that are based on movement in nature A sundial shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a flat surface There is a range of duration timers a well-known example being the hourglass Water clocks along with the sundials are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments A major advance occurred with the invention of the verge escapement which made possible the first mechanical clocks around 1300 in Europe which kept time with oscillating timekeepers like balance wheels.Traditionally in horology the term clock was used for a striking clock while a clock that did not strike the hours audibly was called a timepiece This distinction is no longer made Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one 's person are usually not referred to as clocks Spring-driven clocks appeared during the 15th century During the 15th and 16th centuries clockmaking flourished The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the pendulum clock by Christiaan Huygens A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation The mechanism of a timepiece with a series of gears driven by a spring or weights is referred to as clockwork the term is used by extension for a similar mechanism not used in a timepiece The electric clock was patented in 1840 and electronic clocks were introduced in the 20th century becoming widespread with the development of small battery-powered semiconductor devices The timekeeping element in every modern clock is a harmonic oscillator a physical object ( resonator ) that vibrates or oscillates at a particular frequency This object can be a pendulum a tuning fork a quartz crystal or the vibration of electrons in atoms as they emit microwaves Clocks have different ways of displaying the time Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional clock face with moving hands Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time Two numbering systems are in use 12-hour time notation and 24-hour notation Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and LCD LED or VFD displays For the blind and for use over telephones speaking clocks state the time audibly in words There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch The study of timekeeping is known as horology == Etymology == The word clock derives from the medieval Latin word for 'bell'—clocca—and has cognates in many European languages Clocks spread to England from the Low Countries so the English word came from the Middle Low German and Middle Dutch Klocke The word derives from the Middle English clokke Old North French cloque or Middle Dutch clocke
/m/02vkqh8,A wardrobe or armoire or almirah is a standing closet used for storing clothes The earliest wardrobe was a chest and it was not until some degree of luxury was attained in regal palaces and the castles of powerful nobles that separate accommodation was provided for the apparel of the great The name of wardrobe was then given to a room in which the wall-space was filled with closets and lockers the drawer being a comparatively modern invention From these cupboards and lockers the modern wardrobe with its hanging spaces sliding shelves and drawers evolved slowly Throughout the chronological changes in the form of the enclosure it has more or less retained its preset function as a place to retain a king ’ s robe The word has gained coinage over successive generations as an independent store for among others preserving precious items for a ruler like gold well highlighted in King Edward I of England 's times It is also a simple patio where clothes are hung from metal bars or tucked inside utility racks running from up to down The modern wardrobe differs in one respect from the historical one for its triple partitioning there are two linear compartments on either side with shelves as well as a middle space made up of hanging pegs and drawers the latter being a latter-day addition besides a clothes ’ press in the higher central space on level with a person ’ s chest Additionally an armoire is a wardrobe that is wider than a grown adult 's arm span while a wardrobe is smaller == Etymology == The word wardrobe appeared in the English language in the early 14th century It originated from Old French words warderobe wardereube and garderobe in which `` warder '' meant `` to keep to guard '' and `` robe '' meant `` garment '' == History == In the United States the wardrobe in its moveable form as an oak `` hanging cupboard '' dates back to the early 17th century At that time it was an early export product from America to England because English woodlands were over-harvested or reserved for the Navy Consequently the item was sometimes referred to as an oakley For probably a hundred years such pieces massive and cumbrous in form but often with well-carved fronts were produced in moderate numbers then the gradual diminution in the use of oak for cabinet-making produced a change of fashion in favor of the more plentiful American walnut ( The virgin American forests became successively Oak then Maple with successive deforestation episodes ) Walnut succeeded oak as the favourite material for furniture but hanging wardrobes in walnut appear to have been made very rarely although clothes presses with drawers and sliding trays were frequent During a large portion of the 18th century the tallboy was much used for storing clothes === Size === A common feature was to base future size on the eight small men method A considered good size double wardrobe would thus be able to hold within its capacity eight small
/m/0174k2,A washing machine ( laundry machine clothes washer washer or simply wash ) is a home appliance used to wash laundry The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to dry cleaning ( which uses alternative cleaning fluids and is performed by specialist businesses ) or ultrasonic cleaners The user adds laundry detergent which is sold in liquid or powder form to the wash water == History == === Washing by hand === Laundering by hand involves soaking beating scrubbing and rinsing dirty textiles Before indoor plumbing individuals also had to carry all the water used for washing boiling and rinsing the laundry from a pump well or spring Water for the laundry would be hand carried heated on a fire for washing then poured into the tub That made the warm soapy water precious it would be reused first to wash the least soiled clothing then to wash progressively dirtier laundry Removal of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process First soap would be rinsed out with clear water After rinsing the soaking wet clothing would be formed into a roll and twisted by hand to extract water The entire process often occupied an entire day of hard work plus drying and ironing Nearly five billion of the world 's population of seven billion as of 2010 still hand-wash their clothes === Early machines === An early example of washing by machine is the practice of fulling In a fulling mill cloth was beaten with wooden hammers known as fulling stocks or fulling hammers The first English patent under the category of washing machines was issued in 1691 A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of The Gentleman 's Magazine a British publication Jacob Christian Schäffer 's washing machine design was published in 1767 in Germany In 1782 Henry Sidgier issued a British patent for a rotating drum washer and in the 1790s Edward Beetham sold numerous `` patent washing mills '' in England One of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves fingers or paddles to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes The person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud This crude agitator technology was hand-powered but still more effective than actually hand-washing the clothes More advancements were made to washing machine technology in the form of the rotative drum design Basically these early design patents consisted of a drum washer that was hand-cranked to make the wooden drums rotate While the technology was simple enough it was a milestone in the history of washing machines as it introduced the idea of `` powered '' washing drums As metal drums started to replace the traditional wooden drums it allowed for the drum to turn above an open fire or an enclosed fire chamber raising the water temperature
/m/0bjyj5,A waste container also known as a dustbin garbage can and trash can is a type of container that is usually made out of metal or plastic The words `` rubbish '' `` basket '' and `` bin '' are more common in British English usage `` trash '' and `` can '' are more common in American English usage `` Garbage '' may refer to food waste specifically ( when distinguished from `` trash '' ) or to municipal solid waste in general == Designs == A pedal bin is a container with a lid operated by a foot pedal Lillian Moller Gilbreth an industrial engineer and efficiency expert invented the pedal bin in the 1920s for the disposal of kitchen waste The foot pedal enables the user to open the lid without touching it with their hands In the 2010s some bins have begun to include automated mechanisms such as a lid with infrared detection on the top of the can powered by batteries to open it rather than a foot pedal freeing the user from touching the bin in any way This helps prevent the bin lids becoming clogged with trash These wastes containers are mostly made of stainless steel Some bin models also include a small receptable for an air freshener == Origins == === French === Legislation surrounding waste receptacles was first introduced in France in an 1883 prefectural order signed by Eugène Poubelle from whose name the French word for a waste receptacle comes This order mandated the provision and collection of waste bins to each household in Paris These bins were specified as having to be between 80 and 120 litres in volume and having a handle and a lid Three waste bins were to be allocated to each household in order to sort refuse from reclaimable fibres such as paper and cloth and other reusable materials like ceramics glasses and oyster shells === English === Legislation setting out the responsibilities for the provision and collection of `` receptacles for the temporary deposit and collection of dust ashes and rubbish '' by local authorities in Britain was first set out in the Public Health Act 1875 However this did not mandate the use of them leaving the decision to offer the service to local government instead == Household collection == In many cities and towns there is a public waste collection service which regularly collects household waste from outside buildings The waste is loaded into a garbage truck and driven to a landfill incinerator or crush facility to be disposed of In some areas each household has multiple bins for different categories of rubbish ( usually represented by colours ) depending on its suitability for recycling which will instead be routed to a recycling center.Roadside waste collection is often done by means of larger metal containers of varying designs mostly called dumpsters in the US and skips in the UK == Public collection == Public areas such as parks often have litter bins placed to improve the social environment by encouraging people not to litter
/m/0gjkl,A match is a tool for starting a fire Typically matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper One end is coated with a material that can be ignited by friction generated by striking the match against a suitable surface Wooden matches are packaged in matchboxes and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks The coated end of a match known as the match `` head '' consists of a bead of active ingredients and binder often colored for easier inspection There are two main types of matches safety matches which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface and strike-anywhere matches for which any suitably frictional surface can be used Because of the substance used to coat each match this makes them non-biodegradable == Etymology == Historically the term match referred to lengths of cord ( later cambric ) impregnated with chemicals and allowed to burn continuously These were used to light fires and fire guns ( see matchlock ) and cannons ( see linstock ) Such matches were characterised by their burning speed i.e quick match and slow match Depending on its formulation a slow match burns at a rate of around 30 cm ( 1 ft ) per hour and a quick match at 4 to 60 centimetres ( 2 to 24 in ) per minute The modern equivalent of this sort of match is the simple fuse still used in pyrotechnics to obtain a controlled time delay before ignition The original meaning of the word still persists in some pyrotechnics terms such as black match ( a black-powder-impregnated fuse ) and Bengal match ( a firework akin to sparklers producing a relatively long-burning colored flame ) But when friction matches became commonplace they became the main object meant by the term The word ‘ match ’ derives from Old French ‘ mèche ’ referring to the wick of a candle == History == === Early matches === A note in the text Cho Keng Lu written in 1366 describes a sulfur match small sticks of pinewood impregnated with sulfur used in China by `` impoverished court ladies '' in AD 577 during the conquest of Northern Qi During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms ( AD 907–960 ) a book called the Records of the Unworldly and the Strange written by Chinese author Tao Gu in about 950 stated If there occurs an emergency at night it may take some time to make a light to light a lamp But an ingenious man devised the system of impregnating little sticks of pinewood with sulfur and storing them ready for use At the slightest touch of fire they burst into flame One gets a little flame like an ear of corn This marvelous thing was formerly called a `` light-bringing slave '' but afterward when it became an article of commerce its name was changed to 'fire inch-stick Another text Wu Lin Chiu Shih dated from 1270 AD lists sulfur matches as something that was sold in the markets of Hangzhou around

/m/02vwcm,Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash Various grains ( which may be malted ) are used for different varieties including barley corn rye and wheat Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks which are typically made of charred white oak Uncharred white oak casks previously used for the aging of sherry are also sometimes used Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains distillation and aging in wooden barrels == Etymology == The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water '' ( now written as uisce in Modern Irish and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) This Gaelic word shares its ultimate origins with Germanic water and Slavic voda of the same meaning Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) This was translated into Old Irish as uisce beatha which became Uisce beatha ( Irish pronunciation [ ˈɪʃcə ˈbʲahə ] ) in Irish and uisge beatha [ ˈɯʃkʲə ˈbɛhə ] in Scottish Gaelic Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) usquebaugh ( 1610 ) usquebath ( 1621 ) and usquebae ( 1715 ) === Names and spellings === Much is made of the word 's two spellings whisky and whiskey There are two schools of thought on the issue One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour or recognize and recognise ) and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label the spelling on the label should not be altered.The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States while whisky is used in all other whisky-producing countries In the US the usage has not always been consistent From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides Since the 1960s American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US However some prominent American brands such as George Dickel Maker 's Mark and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) use the whisky spelling on their labels and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits the legal regulations for spirit in the US also use the whisky spelling throughout === Scotch === Within Scotland the whisky that is made in Scotland is simply called whisky while outside Scotland ( and in the UK regulations that govern its production
/m/02d9qx,A whiteboard ( also known by the terms marker board dry-erase board dry-wipe board and pen-board ) is a glossy usually white surface for making non-permanent markings Whiteboards are analogous to blackboards but with a smoother surface allowing for rapid marking and erasing of markings on their surface The popularity of whiteboards increased rapidly in the mid-1990s and they have become a fixture in many offices meeting rooms school classrooms and other work environments The term whiteboard is also used metaphorically in reference to features of computer software applications that simulate whiteboards Such `` virtual tech whiteboards '' allow one or more people to write or draw images on a simulated canvas This is a common feature of many virtual meeting collaboration and instant messaging applications The term whiteboard is also used to refer to interactive whiteboards == History == Photographer Martin Heit and Alliance employee Albert Stallion have been credited with the invention of the whiteboard Whiteboards became commercially available in the early 1960s but did not become widely used until 30 years later Early whiteboards needed to be wiped with a damp cloth and markers had a tendency to leave marks behind even after erasing the board Dry-erase markers for whiteboards were invented in 1975.Whiteboards began being commonly used by businesses in the early 1990s They became more common in classrooms during the 1990s due to concerns over health problems in children with dust allergies and the potential for chalk dust to damage computers By the late 1990s about 21 % of American classrooms had converted from chalkboards to whiteboards == Types == The first whiteboards were very expensive and were made of an enameled steel Cheaper versions were then produced including laminated chipboard high-pressure laminates and steel boards with a matte-finished or glossy white usually polyester or acrylic coating Enameled whiteboards also referred to as porcelain and sometimes glass boards have the advantage that markings can be erased completely other materials tend to become stained over time Enameled boards are more expensive and less used in commercial environments but in more demanding environments with heavier use such as educational establishments porcelain boards are considered superior Other types of dry marker boards are also available such as high gloss vinyl and coated paper which can be rolled up high-density two-part high gloss paints glass and coated acrylics and polypropylene magic whiteboards which use static electricity to cling to walls windows and doors Clear marker surfaces made of glass ( matte or glossy ) or specially coated acrylic became available around the mid-2000s They are generally manufactured from technical glass e.g for monitor screen filters which is optically coated === Adhesive whiteboards === Whiteboard material can be bought in rolls sheets and pre-formed boards Adhesive whiteboards come in either a sheet or a roll and feature a stick back enabling the user to create a custom size board or project with the material Although adhesive whiteboard material does not come in a thick hard glass or painted steel plate the melamine allows for a flexible material while preserving the high-quality whiteboard
/m/0d4v4,Charles-Marie-Jean-Albert Widor ( 21 February 1844 – 12 March 1937 ) was a French organist composer and teacher of the mid-Romantic era most notable for his ten organ symphonies His Toccata from the fifth organ symphony has become one of the best known and most often performed works for organ As of 2022 he is the longest-serving organist of Saint-Sulpice in Paris a role he held for 63 years ( January 1870 – 31 December 1933 ) He also was organ professor at the Paris Conservatory from 1890 to 1896 ( following César Franck ) and then he became professor of composition at the same institution following Théodore Dubois Widor was a prolific composer writing music for organ piano voice and ensembles Apart from his ten organ symphonies he also wrote three symphonies for orchestra and organ several songs for piano and voice four operas and a ballet He was one of the first composers to use the term `` symphony '' for some of his organ compositions helped in this by the organs built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll == Life == Widor was born in Lyon to a family of organ builders and initially studied music there with his father Hungarian-born François-Charles Widor titular organist of Saint-François-de-Sales from 1838 to 1889 His mother was Françoise-Elisabeth Peiron The French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll reviver of the art of organ building was a friend of the Widor family he arranged for the talented young organist to study in Brussels in 1863 with Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens for organ technique and with the elderly François-Joseph Fétis director of the Brussels Conservatoire for composition After this term of study Widor moved to Paris where he resided for the rest of his life At the age of 24 he was appointed assistant to Camille Saint-Saëns at Église de la Madeleine In January 1870 with the combined lobbying of Cavaillé-Coll Saint-Saëns and Charles Gounod the 25-year-old Widor was appointed as `` provisional '' organist of Saint-Sulpice in Paris the most prominent position for a French organist The organ at St-Sulpice was Cavaillé-Coll 's masterwork the instrument 's spectacular capabilities proved an inspiration to Widor Despite his job 's ostensibly `` provisional '' nature Widor remained as organist at St-Sulpice for nearly 64 years until the end of 1933 He was succeeded in 1934 by his former student and assistant Marcel Dupré In 1890 upon the death of César Franck Widor succeeded him as organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire The class he inherited was initially stunned by this new teacher who suddenly demanded a formidable technique and a knowledge of J. S. Bach 's organ works as prerequisites to effective improvisation Later ( 1896 ) he gave up this post to become composition professor at the same institution Widor had several students in Paris who were to become famous composers and organists in their own right most notably the aforementioned Dupré Louis Vierne Charles Tournemire Darius Milhaud Alexander Schreiner Edgard Varèse and the Canadian Henri Gagnon Albert Schweitzer also studied with Widor mainly from 1899 master and pupil later collaborated
/m/031b6r,A window blind is a type of window covering There are many different kinds of window blinds which use a variety of control systems A typical window blind is made up of several long horizontal or vertical slats of various types of hard material including wood plastic or metal which are held together by cords that run through the blind slats Vertical blinds run along a track system which can tilt open and closed and move side-to-side Window blinds can be manoeuvred with either a manual or remote control by rotating them from an open position with slats spaced out to a closed position where slats overlap and block out most of the light There are also several types of window coverings called shades that use a single piece of soft material instead of slats The term window blinds can also be used to describe window coverings more broadly In this context window blinds include almost every type of window covering whether it is a hard or soft material i.e shutters roller shades cellular shades ( also called honeycomb shades ) wood blinds Roman shades standard vertical and horizontal blinds ( also called Venetians ) In the United Kingdom awnings are sometimes called blinds or shades == Overview == Window blinds generally sold as either ready-made or made to measure As the names suggest blinds that are ready-made are manufactured to set sizes based on typical window dimensions whereas blinds that are made to a measurement are cut to a specific width and drop to match the window The advantage of ready-made blinds is their availability and cost whereas blinds that are made to measure will be more expensive but better fit the dimensions of a window Aside from coming in different dimensions window blinds can also come in a variety of different styles materials colours and patterns Below is a list of several popular styles of blinds Panel Pleated Roller Roman Venetian Vertical WoodenWindow blinds can be manually drawn using a cord or automated through motorization Controls for motorized blinds can be from a wall switch or keypad remote control or computer eliminating the need for cords and allowing control of otherwise inaccessible windows A number of modern homes are integrating blind control with central C-Bus solutions This control provides ease of use and is effective for controlling blind operation to reduce heat loss during winter or minimize heat from the sun during summer == Types == === Panel === Panel blinds sometimes referred to as Japanese blinds as they are based on Japanese shōji are thin blinds in a panel shape that run along a track Almost any fabric or paper can be employed although 90 % of all shoji blinds use white polyester to imitate 'washi Japanese paper === Cellular shades === Cellular shades or cellular blinds sometimes referred to as honeycomb shades are a type of window blind made of a long and continuous fabric with a cellular structure when opened and fold onto themselves when closed The fabric is often made from soft paper or cloth-like material
/m/081qc,Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet 's surface Winds occur on a range of scales from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles and the rotation of the planet ( Coriolis effect ) Within the tropics and subtropics thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds in areas that have variable terrain mountain and valley breezes can prevail Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale their speed and direction the forces that cause them the regions in which they occur and their effect Winds have various aspects velocity ( wind speed ) the density of the gas involved energy content or wind energy In meteorology winds are often referred to according to their strength and the direction from which the wind is blowing The convention for directions refer to where the wind comes from therefore a 'western or 'westerly wind blows from the west to the east a 'northern wind blows south and so on This is sometimes counter-intuitive Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts Strong winds of intermediate duration ( around one minute ) are termed squalls Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength such as breeze gale storm and hurricane In outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet 's atmosphere into space The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn In human civilization the concept of wind has been explored in mythology influenced the events of history expanded the range of transport and warfare and provided a power source for mechanical work electricity and recreation Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth 's oceans Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft When winds become strong trees and human-made structures can be damaged or destroyed Winds can shape landforms via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils for example loess and by erosion Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions Wind also affects the spread of wildfires Winds can disperse seeds from various plants enabling the survival and dispersal of those
/m/09tvcd,A wine glass is a type of glass that is used to drink and taste wine Most wine glasses are stemware ( goblets ) i.e. they are composed of three parts the bowl stem and foot == Shapes == The effect of glass shape on the taste of wine has not been demonstrated decisively by any scientific study and remains a matter of debate One study suggests that the shape of the glass is important as it concentrates the flavour and aroma ( or bouquet ) to emphasize the varietal 's characteristic One common belief is that the shape of the glass directs the wine itself into the best area of the mouth for the varietal despite flavour being perceived by olfaction in the upper nasal cavity not the mouth The importance of wine glass shape could also be based on false ideas about the arrangement of different taste buds on the tongue such as the discredited tongue map.Most wine glasses are stemware that is they are goblets composed of three parts the bowl stem and foot In some designs the opening of the glass is narrower than the widest part of the bowl to concentrate the aroma Others are more open like inverted cones In addition `` stemless '' wine glasses ( tumblers ) are available in a variety of sizes and shapes The latter are typically used more casually than their traditional counterparts.Some common types of wine glasses are described below === Red wine glasses === Glasses for red wine are characterized by their rounder wider bowl which increases the rate of oxidation As oxygen from the air chemically interacts with the wine flavor and aroma are believed to be subtly altered This process of oxidation is generally considered more compatible with red wines whose complex flavours are said to be smoothed out after being exposed to air Red wine glasses can have particular styles of their own such as Bordeaux glass tall with a broad bowl and is designed for full bodied red wines like Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah as it directs wine to the back of the mouth Burgundy glass broader than the Bordeaux glass it has a bigger bowl to accumulate aromas of more delicate red wines such as Pinot noir This style of glass directs wine to the tip of the tongue === White wine glasses === White wine glasses vary enormously in size and shape from the delicately tapered Champagne flute to the wide and shallow glasses used to drink Chardonnay Different shaped glasses are used to accentuate the unique characteristics of different styles of wine Wide-mouthed glasses function similarly to red wine glasses discussed above promoting rapid oxidation which alters the flavor of the wine White wines which are best served slightly oxidized are generally full-flavored wines such as oaked chardonnay For lighter fresher styles of white wine oxidation is less desirable as it is seen to mask the delicate nuances of the wine To preserve a crisp clean flavored wine many white wine glasses will have a smaller mouth which reduces surface area

/m/04169hn,"A wood-burning stove ( or wood burner or log burner in the UK ) is a heating or cooking appliance capable of burning wood fuel and wood-derived biomass fuel such as sawdust bricks Generally the appliance consists of a solid metal ( usually cast iron or steel ) closed firebox often lined by fire brick and one or more air controls ( which can be manually or automatically operated depending upon the stove ) The first wood-burning stove was patented in Strasbourg in 1557 This was two centuries before the Industrial Revolution so iron was still prohibitively expensive The first wood-burning stoves were high-end consumer items and only gradually became used widely.The stove is connected by ventilating stove pipe to a suitable flue which will fill with hot combustion gases once the fuel is ignited The chimney or flue gases must be hotter than the outside temperature to ensure combustion gases are drawn out of the fire chamber and up the chimney Wood burners triple the level of harmful indoor air pollution Each year 61,000 premature deaths are attributable to ambient air pollution from residential heating with wood and coal in Europe with an additional 10,000 attributable deaths in North America == Operation == === Air supply === Keeping the air flowing correctly through a wood-burning stove is essential for safe and efficient operation of the stove Fresh air needs to enter the firebox to provide oxygen for the fire as the fire burns the smoke must be allowed to rise through the stove pipe and exit through the chimney To regulate air flow there may be damper devices built into the stove flue and stove pipes By opening or closing the dampers air flow can be increased or decreased which can fan the fire in the firebox or `` dampen '' it by restricting airflow and reducing the flames The dampers can usually be accessed by turning knobs or handles attached to the damper Some stoves adjust their own airflow using mechanical or electronic thermostatic devices The highest heating efficiencies on closed appliances can be attained by controlling the various supplies of air to the stove ( operating the air controls correctly ) On modern stoves owner 's manuals provide documented procedures Fully open air controls may lead to more heat being sent straight up the chimney rather than into the room ( which reduces efficiency ) The biggest problem with leaving the air controls fully open on many stoves is “ overfiring ” Overfiring is caused when too much heat is generated within the fire chamber which will lead to warping buckling and general damage to the stove and its internal components Different stoves have different numbers and types of air controls Modern building techniques have created more airtight homes forcing many stove manufacturers to design their stoves to permit outside air intakes Outside air can improve the overall efficiency of the stove as a heater by drawing cold combustion air directly from the outside instead of drawing preheated air from the room that the stove is in Many modern"

/m/0d5gx,A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders Scholars debate the scope of the word castle but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble This is distinct from a palace which is not fortified from a fortress which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility but not adequately fortified [ a ] and from a fortified settlement which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction Use of the term has varied over time and has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles Over the approximately 900 years when genuine castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features although some such as curtain walls arrowslits and portcullises were commonplace European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community such as mills fertile land or a water source Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber but had their defences replaced later by stone Early castles often exploited natural defences lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep In the late 12th and early 13th centuries a scientific approach to castle defence emerged This led to the proliferation of towers with an emphasis on flanking fire Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle 's firepower These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades such as concentric fortification and inspiration from earlier defences such as Roman forts Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape

/m/01dy8n,Woodpeckers are part of the bird family Picidae which also includes the piculets wrynecks and sapsuckers [ 1 ] Members of this family are found worldwide except for Australia New Guinea New Zealand Madagascar and the extreme polar regions Most species live in forests or woodland habitats although a few species are known that live in treeless areas such as rocky hillsides and deserts and the Gila woodpecker specialises in exploiting cacti Members of this family are chiefly known for their characteristic behaviour They mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees and often communicate by drumming with their beaks producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance Some species vary their diet with fruits birds eggs small animals tree sap human scraps and carrion They usually nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds They sometimes come into conflict with humans when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees The Picidae are one of nine living families in the order Piciformes the others being barbets ( comprising three families ) toucans toucan-barbets and honeyguides which ( along with woodpeckers ) comprise the clade Pici and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation with one the Bermuda flicker being extinct and a further two possibly being so
/m/084hf,Worms are many different distantly related bilateral animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body no limbs and no eyes ( though not always ) Worms vary in size from microscopic to over 1 metre ( 3.3 ft ) in length for marine polychaete worms ( bristle worms ) [ 1 ] 6.7 metres ( 22 ft ) for the African giant earthworm Microchaetus rappi [ 2 ] and 58 metres ( 190 ft ) for the marine nemertean worm ( bootlace worm ) Lineus longissimus [ 3 ] Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches living inside the bodies of other animals Free-living worm species do not live on land but instead live in marine or freshwater environments or underground by burrowing In biology worm refers to an obsolete taxon vermes used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals now seen to be paraphyletic The name stems from the Old English word wyrm Most animals called worms are invertebrates but the term is also used for the amphibian caecilians and the slowworm Anguis a legless burrowing lizard Invertebrate animals commonly called worms include annelids ( earthworms and marine polychaete or bristle worms ) nematodes ( roundworms ) platyhelminthes ( flatworms ) marine nemertean worms ( bootlace worms ) marine Chaetognatha ( arrow worms ) priapulid worms and insect larvae such as grubs and maggots Worms may also be called helminths—particularly in medical terminology—when referring to parasitic worms especially the Nematoda ( roundworms ) and Cestoda ( tapeworms ) which reside in the intestines of their host When an animal or human is said to have worms it means that it is infested with parasitic worms typically roundworms or tapeworms Lungworm is also a common parasitic worm found in various animal species such as fish and cats
